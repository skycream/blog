      "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a disorder due to the retrograde flow of refluxate into the esophagus. Although GERD is a common clinical diagnosis, its pathogenesis is quite complex. As a result of its multifactorial development, many patients continue to experience adverse symptoms due to GERD despite prolonged acid suppression with proton pump inhibitor therapy. The pathogenesis of GERD involves an interplay of chemical, mechanical, psychologic, and neurologic mechanisms, which contribute to symptom presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. As such, GERD should be approached as a disorder beyond acid. This review will investigate the major factors that contribute to the development of GERD, including factors related to the refluxate, esophageal defenses, and factors that promote pathologic reflux into the esophagus. In reviewing GERD pathogenesis, this paper will highlight therapeutic advances, with mention of future opportunities of study when approaching GERD.",

      "abstract": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in adults and children. The global prevalence of GERD is high and increasing. Non-erosive reflux disease is the most common phenotype of GERD. Heartburn and regurgitation are considered classic symptoms but GERD may present with various atypical and extra-oesophageal manifestations. The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial and different mechanisms may result in GERD symptoms, including gastric composition and motility, anti-reflux barrier, refluxate characteristics, clearance mechanisms, mucosal integrity and symptom perception. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of GERD is commonly established on the basis of response to anti-reflux treatment; however, a more accurate diagnosis requires testing that includes upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and reflux monitoring. New techniques and new reflux testing parameters help to better phenotype the condition. In children, the diagnosis of GERD is primarily based on history and physical examination and treatment vary with age. Treatment in adults includes a combination of lifestyle modifications with pharmacological, endoscopic or surgical intervention. In refractory GERD, optimization of proton-pump inhibitor treatment should be attempted before a series of diagnostic tests to assess the patient's phenotype.",

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 100 LPR patients treated with an association of diet, PPIs, and alginate. Patients were followed from September 2016 to May 2020. At the end of the initial 3-to-6 months therapeutic period, LPR patients were weaned from PPIs and instructed to respect diet and stress management over the long-term. The 3-year symptom recurrence rate, PPI use, and patient awareness of PPI adverse events were assessed. Sixty-seven patients completed the evaluation. Twenty-seven patients (40.3%) reported a chronic course of LPR-symptoms, requiring chronic or occasional PPI use. LPR symptom recurrence occurred 1-to-2 or 3-to-5 times yearly in 8.9% and 20.9% of patients, respectively. Recurrences were managed by short-term diet, alginate, or PPI intake. The remaining patients (29.9%) did not report middle-term LPR recurrence. The 3-year weaning rate of occasional or chronic use of PPIs was 64.2%. Among participants, 26.8% were aware of PPI-related adverse events, most frequently through physicians (33%), online sources (17%), and friends or family (17%). Nonresponder patients were significantly more aware of PPI adverse events than responders (P = 0.029). PPI-attributed adverse events occurred in 29.8% of patients. Sixty-four percent of LPR patients treated with PPIs were weaned at 3-year posttreatment time. Different forms of LPR may exist regarding symptom relief, recurrences, and chronic course.",

A number of studies on GERD were subsequently conducted in Japan and abroad, and vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), became available for the first time in Japan in February 2015. The revised 3rd edition (Japanese edition), which incorporates new findings and information, was published in April 2021. These guidelines are summarized herein, particularly sections related to the treatment of GERD. The important clinical issues addressed in the present revision are (i) the introduction of treatment algorithms that classify GERD into reflux esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease, (ii) the clarification of treatment algorithms based on to the severity of reflux esophagitis, and (iii) the positioning of vonoprazan in the treatment for GERD. The present guidelines propose vonoprazan as the initial/maintenance treatment for severe reflux esophagitis. They also recommend vonoprazan or PPI as an initial treatment for mild reflux esophagitis and recommended PPI and proposed vonoprazan as maintenance treatment. These updated guidelines offer the best clinical strategies for GERD patients in Japan and hope that they will be of global use for the diagnosis and treatment for GERD.",

Optimization of therapy (improving compliance and timing of PPI doses), or increasing PPI dosage to twice daily in select circumstances, can reduce persistent symptoms. Patients with continued symptoms can be evaluated with endoscopy and tests of esophageal physiology, to better determine their disease phenotype and optimize treatment. Laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation, and endoscopic therapies can benefit patients with well-characterized GERD. Patients with functional diseases that overlap with or mimic GERD can also be treated with neuromodulators (primarily antidepressants), or psychological interventions (psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapy). Future approaches to treatment of GERD include potassium-competitive acid blockers, reflux-reducing agents, bile acid binders, injection of inert substances into the esophagogastric junction, and electrical stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter.",

Vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, has better efficacy than PPI in suppressing gastric acid secretion. This meta-analysis summarizes the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan for treating PPI-resistant GERD (both erosive esophagitis [EE] and non-erosive reflux disease [NERD]). Four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL) were searched for studies indexed until August 1, 2023. Both observational studies and clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan in PPI-resistant GERD were included. Efficacy outcomes included healing and maintenance rates of EE and improvement of the Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD (FSSG) scores. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered a safety outcome. The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess study quality. Twelve studies were included in this meta-analysis. Healing rates of PPI-resistant EE with vonoprazan 20 mg were 91.7% (95% CI 86.8-94.8%) and 88.5% (95% CI 69.7-96.2%) at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. For healed PPI-resistant EE, the overall maintenance rates with vonoprazan 10 mg were 82.6% (95% 61.2-95.0%) at week 8, 86.0% (95% CI 72.1-94.7%) at week 24, and 93.8% (95% CI 69.8-99.8%) at week 48. FSSG scores were improved in 74.6% (95% CI 65.8-81.7%) and 51.9% (95% CI 37.8-65.7%) of patients at weeks 4 and 8. Overall, no SAE was reported. Vonoprazan demonstrated high efficacy in the healing and maintenance of PPI-resistant EE and moderate efficacy for the improvement of FSSG score.

Reflux can recur in between 3% and 30% of patients on whom antireflux surgery has been performed, and so revision surgery can be required due to recurrent symptoms or dysphagia in approximately 3% to 6% of the patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the mechanism of recurrences after antireflux surgery and to share our results after revision surgery in recurrent cases.From 2001 to 2014, revision surgery was performed on 43 patients (31 men, 12 women) between the ages of 24 and 70 years. The technical details of the first operation, recurrence symptoms, endoscopy, and manometry findings were evaluated. The findings of revision surgery, surgical techniques, morbidity rates, length of hospitalization, and follow-up period were also recorded and evaluated.The first operation was Nissen fundoplication in 34 patients and Toupet fundoplication in 9 patients. Mesh hiatoplasty was performed for enforcement in 18 (41.9%) of these patients. The period between the first operation and the revision surgery ranged from 4 days to 60 months. The most common finding was slipped fundoplication and presence of hiatal hernia during revision surgery. Revision fundoplication and hernia repair with mesh reinforcement were used in 33 patients. The other techniques were Collis gastroplasty, revision fundoplication, and hernia repair without mesh. The range of follow-up period was from 2 to 134 months. Recurrence occurred in 3 patients after revision surgery (6.9%). Although revision surgery is difficult and it has higher morbidity, it can be performed effectively and safely in experienced centers.",

The aim of this initiative was to develop a modern care paradigm for LPR supported by otolaryngology and gastroenterology disciplines. A 28-member international interdisciplinary working group developed practical statements within the following domains: definition/terminology, initial diagnostic evaluation, reflux monitoring, therapeutic trials, behavioral factors and therapy, and risk stratification. Literature reviews guided statement development and were presented at virtual/in-person meetings. Each statement underwent 2 or more rounds of voting per the RAND Appropriateness Method; statements reaching appropriateness with ≥80% agreement are included as recommendations. The term laryngopharyngeal symptoms (LPS) applies to aerodigestive symptoms with potential to be induced by reflux and include cough, voice change, throat clearing, excess throat phlegm, and throat pain. Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) refers to patients with LPS and objective evidence of reflux. Importantly, the presence of LPS does not equate to LPRD. Laryngoscopy has value in assessing for nonreflux laryngopharyngeal processes, but laryngoscopic findings alone cannot diagnose LPRD. LPS patients should be categorized as with or without concurrent esophageal reflux symptoms. While lifestyle modification and empiric trials of acid suppression ± alginates are appropriate when esophageal reflux symptoms coexist, upper endoscopy and ambulatory reflux monitoring are required for LPRD diagnosis when symptoms persist, when LPS is isolated, or when management needs to be escalated to include invasive antireflux management. The two recommended ambulatory reflux monitoring modalities, 24-hour pH-impedance and 96-hour wireless pH monitoring, are not mutually exclusive with distinct roles for the evaluation of LPS. Laryngeal hyperresponsiveness and hypervigilance commonly contribute to both LPS and LPRD presentations and are responsive to laryngeal recalibration therapy and neuromodulators. The San Diego Consensus represents the formal modern-day interdisciplinary care paradigm to evaluate and manage LPS and LPRD.",

One hundred patients (39 males, 61 females) underwent the procedure in a prospective trial. Mean age was 40 years (range 18-68). Mean preoperative BMI was 43.2 kg/m(2) (range 35-62). The procedure was performed by laparoscopy starting with the creation of a circular opening at the junction of antrum and corpus followed by a vertical stapling to the angle of Hiss. Mean duration of the procedure was 67 (range 40-122) min. No intraoperative complication occurred. Mean hospital stay (SD) was 2.5 (0.9) days. The single postoperative complication consisted in a mild stenosis that responded to endoscopic dilatation. After a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 9-24), mean percentage of excess body weight loss (SD) was 48(14), 59(18) and 68(24)%, respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months.

In the intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of treatment success was 44% in the intervention group (22 of 50) vs 24% in the sham group (12 of 50) (risk difference, 20%; 95% CI, 1.8%-38.2%; P = .03). Treatment led to a significant avoidance of sleeping in the right lateral decubitus position (intervention 2.2% vs sham 23.5%; P = .000) and increased time sleeping in the left lateral decubitus position (intervention 60.9% vs sham 38.5%; P = .000). More reflux-free nights were observed in the intervention group (intervention 9 nights [interquartile range, 6-11 nights] vs sham 6 nights [interquartile range, 3-9 nights]; P = .01). Sleep positional therapy using an electronic wearable device promotes sleeping in the left lateral decubitus position and effectively alleviates nocturnal reflux symptoms compared with sham treatment (https://www.trialregister.nl, NL8655).",

Increased body mass index and accumulation of visceral fat are associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of developing reflux symptoms and esophageal lesions. Given this association, many studies were designed to evaluate the outcome of reflux symptoms following conventional and surgical treatment of obesity. Among bariatric procedures, gastric sleeve and banded gastroplasty were shown to have no effect or even worsen reflux symptoms in the postoperative setting. Gastric banding improves reflux symptoms and findings (endoscopic and pH-measured distal esophageal acid exposure) in many patients, but is associated with de novo reflux symptoms or lesions in a considerable proportion of patients. To date, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most effective bariatric procedure that consistently leads to weight reduction and improvement of GERD symptoms in patients undergoing direct gastric bypass and among those converted from restrictive bariatric procedures to gastric bypass.",

A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology underlying this disease is necessary to improve the current standard of care. Most GERD pathophysiology models focus on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) as the key element which prevents esophageal reflux. More recent research has highlighted the crural diaphragm (CD) as an additional critical component of the GERD barrier. We now know that the CD actively relaxes when the distal esophagus is distended and contracts when the stomach is distended. Crural myotomy in animal models increases esophageal acid exposure, highlighting the CD's vital role. There are also multiple physiological studies in patients with symptomatic hiatal hernia that demonstrate CD dysfunction is associated with GERD. Finally, computer models integrating physiological data predict that the CD and the LES each contribute roughly 50% to the GERD barrier. This more robust understanding has implications for future procedural management of GERD. Specifically, effective GERD management mandates repair of the CD and reinforcement of the LES. Given the high rate of hiatal hernia recurrences, it seems that novel antireflux procedures should target this essential component of the GERD barrier. Future research should focus on methods to maintain crural integrity, decrease hiatal hernia recurrence, and improve long-term competency of the GERD barrier.",

Central obesity increases abdominal-thoracic pressure gradient and disrupts the gastroesophageal junction by inducing hiatal hernia formation. Obese patients benefit from weight loss by diet to decrease GERD symptoms; however, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is associated with a higher weight loss and a decrease in GERD symptoms, and is considered the best way to treat both diseases at the same time.",

The purpose of this manuscript is an overview on the different pathophysiologic components of GERD, their influence as well as a certain weighing of their involvement in the disease. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) represents together with the muscles and ligamentous structures of the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus the antireflux barrier between esophagus and stomach. The crucial factor in GERD is an increased amount of gastric contents refluxing into the esophagus above the physiologic level. This creates pathologic esophageal acid exposure (EAE) to the mucosa, which may lead to symptoms and damage. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are anatomical components such as LES and diaphragm, and functional components such as LES-incompetence, transient LES relaxations, impaired esophageal motility, gastroduodenal dysfunctions and alterations of the refluxate such as duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux. The quantitative assessment of these components has been reported in a number of studies demonstrating the importance of LES-incompetence (incidence 80 %) and the role of hiatal hernia (incidence 80 %) in the severity of GERD indicated by excessive esophageal acid exposure and visible damage of the esophageal mucosa. All known pathophysiologic components of GERD can be investigated currently by diagnostic assessment, detecting a LES-incompetence or an increase in transient relaxations, detecting a hiatal hernia with increasing size, detecting increasing exposure to gastric contents in addition to other possible functional associated disorders such as an insufficient esophageal motility and or a delayed gastric emptying, which all can aggravate the disease and the patient's status.",

The search only yielded a handful of articles, so we independently included relevant studies from these review articles along with related citations as suggested by PubMed. We found diabetic patients are more prone to developing GERD and may present with atypical manifestations. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the connection between these two diseases. Studies involving treatment options for comorbid disease suggest conflicting drug-drug interactions. Currently, there are no published guidelines specifically for the evaluation and management of GERD in the diabetic patient.

The most characteristic symptom of the disease is heartburn, which occurs at least once a week. The prevalence of the disease varies and, depending on the region of the world, it may affect from a few to over 30% of an adult population. It is estimated that in Poland this disease may affect up to 35.5% of adults reporting abdominal ailments. If untreated, the disease can lead to serious complications including precancerous conditions and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Pharmacotherapy is considered as the first-line treatment in GERD patients but lifestyle modifications, including diet changes, are an important element supporting the treatment of the disease. Many factors may contribute to the development of the disease. Among them, there are non-modifiable factors such as age, sex or genetic factors and modifiable factors, e.g. lifestyle, diet, excessive body weight. This review focuses on GERD risk factors related to lifestyle and nutrition that include both dietary components and nutritional behaviour. Lifestyle risk factors that may contribute to GERD symptoms include excessive body weight, particularly obesity, moderate/high alcohol consumption, smoking, postprandial and vigorous physical activity, as well as lack of regular physical activity. Many studies indicate fatty, fried, sour, spicy food/products, orange and grapefruit juice, tomatoes and tomato preserves, chocolate, coffee/tea, carbonated beverages, alcohol as triggers for GERD symptoms. Eating habits such as irregular meal pattern, large volume of meals, eating meals just before bedtime may correlate with the symptoms of GERD. The role of lifestyle, diet and eating habits as risk factors for GERD is not clearly understood, and the results of the available studies are often contradictory. Determination of modifiable risk factors for this disease and its symptoms is important for effective dietary prevention and diet therapy of GERD.",

In this population-based study we used routinely collected dispensing data to identify all children born between 2005 and 2012 who were dispensed a government-subsidized PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole) before their first birthday. Unique patient identifiers were used to link administrative datasets containing patient-level demographic, dispensing, and health information. In total, 22,643 children were dispensed a study PPI before their first birthday. The prevalence of infant PPI use as a proportion of all live births increased from 2.4% for children born in 2005 to 5.2% for children born in 2012. Overall, 71.6% of infants were dispensed a PPI by 3 months of age, and 8.7% received a PPI within the first month of life. Before PPI initiation, only 7.0% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of GERD (with or without esophagitis), and 4.7% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of one or more known or suspected GERD risk factors. Off-label prescribing of PPIs to New Zealand infants was relatively common and increased over the study period.
