METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, PEDro) and reference lists of articles and narrative reviews were searched. Articles were included when infants and small children underwent oesophageal pH monitoring or pH-multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring while respiratory physiotherapy was administered. Descriptive analysis was performed and two researchers scored the methodological quality of these studies. RESULTS: Out of 985 articles, seven (six English, one French) have been included, In total 277 patients were involved, 71 with cystic fibrosis. Depending on the technique used, four studies showed GOR to be aggravated during therapy, three studies reported no effect. CONCLUSION: The evidence is not conclusive on whether respiratory physiotherapy induces or aggravates GOR in infants and small children. Age, disease, and treatment options play an important role. More specific research, also focussing on the influence of respiratory physiotherapy on non-acid reflux and the impact of recently developed airway clearance techniques (ACT's) on GOR is necessary.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The involvement of hydrochloric acid in the etiology of eosinophilic esophagitis and numerous reports on its coexistence and interaction with reflux disease, as well as the rings of the esophageal mucosa formed with the advancement of the disease, suggest a potential association of eosinophilic esophagitis with another disorder of esophageal morphology potentially caused by exposure to acid reflux-Schatzki ring. Therefore, it seems reasonable to check the relationship of eosinophilic esophagitis with the coexistence of the Schatzki ring as a potential effect of advanced esophageal trachealization, which is the subject of this systematic review with a meta-analysis. METHODS: The protocol of this meta-analysis was performed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. A systematic search of the indexed literature in the MEDLINE and Scopus databases from early to December 2019 was performed to identify all original research articles on the association between the occurrence of the Schatzki ring and eosinophilic esophagitis in adults. RESULTS: Out of 68 searched studies, after the analysis and evaluation of the works, only 4 met the criteria set according to the protocol and were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the performed meta-analysis, no relationship was found between the occurrence of Schatzki ring and eosinophilic esophagitis. CONCLUSION: The present study did not show a significant relationship between the occurrence of the Schatzki ring and eosinophilic esophagitis in the adult population, which suggests that these are two independent causes of dysphagia in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Achalasia is a rare, benign esophageal motility disorder. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) is the gold standard treatment. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an alternative endoscopic technique that has comparable short-term results to LHM. There are limited data on long-term results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate longer-term outcomes in POEM compared to LHM for the treatment of achalasia. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, Pubmed, Medline and CENTRAL databases through January 2024. We included primary double-arm studies in adult patients with follow-up periods of ≥ 24 months. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as Eckardt score ≤ 3. Secondary outcomes were operation length, length of stay, postoperative complications and postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Two authors independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed quality of evidence using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for Randomized Trials Version 2 and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of Intervention tool. Pooled estimates were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was quantified using the inconsistency statistic, and funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: There were 9 studies included with 1099 patients; 583 underwent POEM with a mean follow-up length of 34.2 months. There was no difference in treatment success between POEM and LHM (OR 1.43; CI 0.96-2.13). POEM had a significantly shorter operative time (MD -35.69 min; CI -50.54-[- 20.83]), shorter length of stay (MD - 0.70 days; CI -1.03-[- 0.36]) and comparable incidence of complications (OR 0.80; CI 0.37-1.73). Meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of esophagitis with POEM when outlier studies were excluded (OR 2.57; CI 1.45-4.53]), though there was a greater odds of continued postoperative PPI use in POEM (OR 1.72; CI 1.03-2.89]). CONCLUSION: POEM appears to have equivalent long-term efficacy to LHM, with possibly higher risk of postoperative GERD. More randomized studies are needed to examine outcomes beyond 2 years and to determine the long-term clinical significance of GERD following POEM.",

Several studies have shown the prevalence of GERD in Iranian population, but their evidence is contradictory. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology of GERD in Iran. METHODS: The entire steps of this systematic review and meta-analysis were based on the MOOSE protocol, and the results were reported accordance with the PRISMA guideline. This review is registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020142861). To find potentially relevant published articles, comprehensive search was done on international online databases Scopus, Science Direct, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Iranian online databases and the Google Scholar search engine in June 2019. Cochran test and I RESULTS: The daily, weekly, monthly, and overall prevalence of GERD symptoms in Iranian population was 5.64% (95%CI [confidence interval]: 3.77-8.35%; N = 66,398), 12.50% (95%CI: 9.63-16.08%; N = 110,388), 18.62% (95%CI: 12.90-26.12%; N = 70,749) and 43.07% (95%CI: 35.00-51.53%; N = 73,189), respectively. The daily, weekly, monthly, and overall prevalence of heartburn in Iranian population was 2.46% (95%CI: 0.93-6.39%; N = 18,774), 9.52% (95%CI: 6.16-14.41%; N = 54,125), 8.19% (95%CI: 2.42-24.30%; N = 19,363) and 23.20% (95%CI: 13.56-36.79%; N = 26,543), respectively. The daily, weekly, monthly, and overall prevalence of regurgitation in Iranian population was 4.00% (95%CI: 1.88-8.32%; N = 18,774), 9.79% (95%CI: 5.99-15.60%; N = 41,140), 13.76% (95%CI: 6.18-44.31%; N = 19,363) and 36.53% (95%CI: 19.30-58.08%; N = 21,174), respectively. The sensitivity analysis for prevalence of all types GERD, heartburn and regurgitation symptoms by removing a study showed that the overall estimate is still robust. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis provides comprehensive and useful information on the epidemiology of GERD in Iran for policy-makers and health care providers. This study showed a high prevalence of GERD in Iran. Therefore, effective measures on GERD-related factors such as lifestyle can be among the health policies of Iran.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a prevalent and chronic disorder impacting a significant proportion of the global population, approximately 15%. Most GERD patients show improvement with medical treatment, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); however, around 40% continue to experience symptoms despite ongoing PPI use. Antireflux mucosal ablation (ARMA) and antireflux mucosectomy (ARMS) are minimally invasive endoscopic procedures for treating GERD. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ARMA and ARMS through the DeMeester score, acid exposure time (AET), and clinical success rate. METHODS: Studies reporting pre- and postprocedure esophageal 24 h pH monitoring following ARMA and ARMS were included. Pooled data analysis assessed changes in the DeMeester score and AET using the standardized mean difference (SMD). Clinical success rate, defined as significant symptom improvement or reduced reliance on PPIs, was also analyzed. RESULTS: Pooled data from three ARMA studies showed a significant postprocedure decrease in median AET (SMD: - 20.74, 95% CI [- 25.51, - 15.97], p < 0.0001). Similarly, six ARMS studies demonstrated a significant reduction in DeMeester score (SMD: - 2.79, 95% CI [- 4.33, - 1.26], p < 0.0001). The overall clinical success rate for ARMS was 78%, while ARMA achieved 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Both ARMA and ARMS displayed promising efficacy in improving GERD-related outcomes based on reductions in AET and DeMeester scores and achieving high clinical success rates. However, the high heterogeneity observed suggests further research is needed to identify patient-specific factors influencing treatment response.",

This meta-analysis aims to systematically review and analyze randomized controlled trials (RCTs) data comparing clinical and safety outcomes for long and short POEM procedures while further investigating differences in GERD and other long-term clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science from inception until October 2024 for RCTs comparing long and short POEM procedures for the treatment of achalasia. Our pooled data was analyzed for clinical and objective procedural success, procedural adverse events, GERD outcomes, procedure time, and hospitalization time. A random effects model was used, and the data was presented using pooled odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Five RCTs were included with 518 achalasia patients (253 in short group and 265 in long group). Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients were similar across studies. Short and long POEM had similar clinical success (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.45-3.06, p = 0.73, I CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that short POEM is clinically non-inferior to long POEM but has advantages in shorter procedure time and lower odds of objective evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease.",

This study was registered in PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (CRD42024532264). RESULTS: This study included a total of 19 RCTs, comparing 16 CHMs. Pairwise meta-analysis indicated that CHM combined with conventional Western medicine outperformed the latter in terms of overall clinical efficacy, recurrence rate, and symptom improvement. Network meta-analysis suggested that Shugan Jieyu Capsule may significantly enhance overall clinical efficacy, while Buzhongyiqi Granules may significantly reduce the recurrence rate, Sanji Powders may significantly improve symptoms of acid reflux, Shugan Jieyu Capsule may significantly improve symptoms of heartburn, and Shugan Jianpi Hewei Decoction may significantly improve symptoms of esophageal chest pain, Qingweishu Granules may significantly improve the frequency scale for the symptoms of GERD score. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the RCTs. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that CHM offers a positive adjunctive therapeutic benefit for rGERD; however, it is imperative to enhance the quality of future RCTs to validate these preliminary findings.",

However, high-level evidence from randomized trials remains limited. We conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence of treatment strategies considering adverse events and oncologic outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, grey literature databases, and clinical trial registries. We included prospective and retrospective studies published between 1990 and 2024 with mono-, bi- or trimodal treatment reporting outcomes such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), resection rates, postoperative mortality/morbidity, and adverse events. Studies required histologically confirmed SST and a minimum of 30 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included (28 retrospective, 7 prospective), with follow-up ranging from 10 to 107 months. Most studies originated from Europe (n = 16) and North America (n = 14). Sample sizes ranged from 30 to 2910 patients, predominantly male and aged in the late 50s to early 60s. Induction CRT protocols varied widely. R0 resection rates were reported in 33 studies, and trimodal therapy outcomes in 12. Hematotoxicity and esophagitis were the most common adverse events. Five-year OS rates varied between 11.8 % and 77 %, with trimodal therapy associated with better survival and distant metastasis as the dominant recurrence pattern. There were no studies addressing immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: While trimodal therapy remains the guideline-endorsed standard for SST, comparative evidence remains sparse. The role of immunotherapy in induction regimens warrants further investigation.",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive literature search in the bibliographic databases Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library through May 2024. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated the pooled odds ratios (OR) for the associations of H. pylori infection and eradication with GERD risk in prospective studies. A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis based on data from the FinnGen study assessed associations between genetically predicted levels of seven H. pylori antibodies, that is, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and six virulence factors (cytotoxin-associated gene A [CagA], Outer Membrane Protein [OMP], vacuolating cytotoxin A [VacA], urease A [UreA], catalase and GroEL), and GERD risk. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible studies were included. Meta-analysis combining data from three cohort studies and one nested case-control study indicated an inverse association between H. pylori infection and GERD (pooled OR = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-1.44). Meta-analysis of 18 cohort studies and three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed an increased risk of GERD after H. pylori eradication (pooled OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.44-2.81), and this association was stronger when specifically analyzing reflux esophagitis (pooled OR = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.57-3.29). No associations were found in Mendelian randomization analysis for any of the studied H. pylori antibodies. [Correction added on 7 August 2025, after first online publication: The Abstract section has been updated to correct the number of studies for eligible and cohort under the Results.] CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that H. pylori infection is associated with a decreased risk of GERD and that H. pylori eradication increases the risk.",

METHODS: These techniques were compared in an open-label randomised controlled trial. This paper focuses on generic health-related QoL (HRQoL) using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and EuroQol-5 Dimension 3-Level questionnaires and disease-specific QoL (DSQoL), using the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire (specifically designed for individuals with obesity to assesses self-esteem, physical activity, work performance, sexual life, eating behaviour, and social interactions)the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GERD-Q); the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI); and the Asthma Control Questionnaire. Simple carbohydrate consumption was assessed with the Dutch Sweet Eating Questionnaire. Measurements were taken preoperatively, 2 months post-surgery, and annually up to 5 years. Analyses used a linear mixed model. Cohen's d (CD) effect sizes indicate small (0∙2), medium (0∙5), and large (0∙8) effects. Dutch Trial Register NTR4741. FINDINGS: From 2013 until 2017, 628 patients were randomised between sleeve gastrectomy (n = 312) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 316). Minimal follow-up was 5 years (last follow-up July 29th, 2022). Mean age was 43 [SD, 11] years; mean BMI 43∙5 [SD, 4∙7] and 81∙8 % were women. No clinically relevant differences in generic HRQoL were observed. Moorehead-Ardelt scored higher in the bypass group at 2 years (difference 0∙4, [95 % CI -0∙6 to -0∙1], P=.002, CD -0∙3), without statistically differences later on. GERD-Q scores were consistently better in the bypass group at all time points and remained higher after 5 years (difference 1∙5, [95 % CI 0∙7 to 2∙3], P<.001, CD 0∙3). GIQLI showed a statistically significant better outcome in the bypass group after 4 and 5 years (difference -4∙6, [95 % CI -8∙7 to -0∙4], P = 0.032, CD -0∙17). Sweet-eating showed no statistically significant differences over time. CONCLUSION: For patients living with severe obesity, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass overall showed good long-term HRQoL and DSQoL outcomes. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was associated with less GERD-related symptoms. Factors such as GERD should be considered when choosing the type of surgery.",

We performed a meta-analysis to reconcile the data. METHODS: Online databases were searched for studies comparing FT to MM POEM for treatment of achalasia. The outcomes of interest were procedure duration (min), clinical success (Eckardt score ≤3), symptomatic reflux, reflux esophagitis, mean Eckardt score, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and adverse events. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies (1226 patients) were included, with 540 in the FT and 686 in the MM groups. Compared with the MM group, the FT group exhibited a higher rate of symptomatic reflux (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.12-2.23, P = .009), with the other outcomes being comparable in the 2 groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that OS was associated with reduced symptomatic reflux compared with FT. While the FT and CM groups had similar rates of symptomatic reflux, the former had shorter procedure duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that MM POEM (the OS technique) may lead to reduced symptomatic reflux compared with FT POEM for achalasia. The limited number of included studies (with most of them being observational) must be considered while interpreting these findings.",

This study aimed to assess the effect of P-CABs on GERD-related chronic cough. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, exploratory trial evaluated adults with chronic cough (≥ 8 weeks) and a recent physician diagnosis of GERD or peptic symptoms (< 1 month). Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either fexuprazan 40 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg (PPI) once daily for eight weeks, along with matched placebos. The primary endpoint was the change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) score from baseline. Secondary endpoints included changes in the cough severity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) scores. Safety was evaluated through monitoring adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 190 subjects recruited, 161 met the selection criteria and were randomized, and 146 completed the trial. The participants were predominantly female (74.3%, mean age 39 ± 12 years). After 8 weeks of treatment, cough-related quality of life improved significantly, with comparable LCQ scores change between the groups (fexuprazan: 4.9 ± 4.0 vs. esomeprazole: 5.3 ± 3.8, p = 0.558). Changes in cough severity NRS and RDQ scores were also similar between the groups. Adverse events were comparable and consisted mostly of mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings support the potential of P-CABs as a promising alternative to PPIs for patients with chronic cough requiring acid-suppressive therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy (LHC) is the preferred treatment of achalasia. It improves dysphagia by dividing muscles of the lower oesophageal sphincter, but this intervention can result in debilitating gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms in some patients. To prevent these reflux symptoms, most surgeons add a fundoplication to Heller's cardiomyotomy, but there is no consensus regarding this or the type of fundoplication which is best suited for the purpose. OBJECTIVES: To assess how the addition of a fundoplication affects postoperative reflux and dysphagia in people undergoing LHC and compare the different types of fundoplications used in combination with LHC to determine which is better at controlling reflux without worsening the dysphagia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched three databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase) on 31 October 2021 and trial registers to identify all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, comparing different fundoplications used in combination with LHC to treat achalasia. We also included RCTs where LHC with a fundoplication is compared with LHC without any fundoplication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We only included RCTs which recruited adult participants with achalasia undergoing LHC with minimal hiatal dissection. We excluded non-randomised studies or studies involving paediatric participants. We also excluded studies where the procedure was done by open surgery and where circumferential hiatal dissection of the oesophagus was carried out, unless it was necessary to reduce a hiatus hernia or to facilitate a Toupet or Nissen fundoplication. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies to be included, assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and extracted the data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effect models with Review Manager (RevMan) software. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies in this review, with a total of 571 participants with an average age of 45 years (range 33.5 to 50). LHC without any fundoplication was performed in 65 (11.3%) participants, 298 (52.1%) had Dor fundoplication, 81 (14.1%) had Toupet fundoplication, 72 (12.6%) had Nissen's fundoplication, and 55 (9.6%) participants had angle of His accentuation. Three studies with a total of 143 participants compared LHC + Dor to LHC without fundoplication. We found that the evidence is very uncertain as to whether the addition of a Dor fundoplication made any difference to the outcome of postoperative pathological acid reflux (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.89; I AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When LHC was performed with minimal hiatal dissection, we were very uncertain whether the addition of a Dor fundoplication made a difference in controlling postoperative reflux, and we were uncertain if it increased the risk of severe postoperative dysphagia. There may be little to no difference in the outcomes of postoperative pathological acid reflux or severe dysphagia between Dor and Toupet fundoplications when used in combination with LHC, but the certainty of the evidence is low. Nissen (total) fundoplication used in combination with LHC for achalasia increased the risk of severe postoperative dysphagia. The angle of His accentuation and Dor fundoplication had a similar effect on severe postoperative dysphagia when combined with LHC, but their effect on postoperative pathological acid reflux was not reported.",

We, therefore, performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of studies evaluating the role of TIF in GERD. METHODS: A systematic search of EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library Central was performed. All original studies reporting outcomes in GERD patients who underwent TIF were identified. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of TIF, and prospective observational studies reporting outcomes after TIF were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies (963 patients) published between 2007 and 2015 were identified, including five RCTs and 13 prospective observational studies. The pooled relative risk of response rate to TIF versus PPIs/sham was 2.44 (95 % CI 1.25-4.79, p = 0.0009) in RCTs in the intention-to-treat analysis. The total number of refluxes was reduced after TIF compared with the PPIs/sham group. The esophageal acid exposure time and acid reflux episodes after TIF were not significantly improved. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) usage increased with time and most of the patients resumed PPIs treatment at reduced dosage during the long-term follow-up. The total satisfaction rate after TIF was about 69.15 % in 6 months. The incidence of severe adverse events consisting of gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding was 2.4 %. CONCLUSIONS: TIF is an alternative intervention in controlling GERD-related symptoms with comparable short-term patient satisfaction. Long-term results showed decreased efficacy with time. Patients often resume PPIs at reduced doses in the near future.",

This systematic review aims to summarize the diagnostic performance of manometric parameters that have been explored as GERD predictors. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and EBSCO (1970-2024) identified studies comparing manometric metrics in adults (≥ 18-years-old) with or without GERD using pH monitoring or Lyon criteria as reference standards. Manometry metrics were compared between groups, diagnostic performance was synthesized, and risk of bias was assessed. KEY RESULTS: We found 59 eligible studies (50 cross-sectional, nine cohort; 10,672 patients). Thresholds for competent lower esophageal sphincter (LES) included overall length < 2 to 3 cm (sensitivity [SE] 2.6%-64%, specificity [SP] 81.5%-98.9%) and abdominal length < 1 cm (SE 4.5%-70%, SP 45%-98.4%). Parameters that differed significantly between GERD and non-GERD groups included: LES pressure in 16/40 studies, EGJ contractile integral (EGJ-CI) in 14/17 studies, and LES pressure integral (LESPI) in 3/4 studies. EGJ morphology differed between the groups using the 2017 Consensus in 6/7 studies and using Akimoto classification in 1/1 study. Transabdominal pressure gradient was significantly different between groups in 5/5 studies. Among novel metrics, total EGJ-CI (SE 81%, SP 52%) and the straight leg raise maneuver (SE 71%-79%, SP 75%-85%) performed best. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Although none of the manometric EGJ metrics reliably predict GERD, some of them show potential in assessing EGJ competence, which could guide treatment as endoscopic and surgical options for restoring competence expand.",

Previous meta-analyses have yielded conflicting results regarding patient-centered outcomes and long-term durability. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing da Vinci-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251139110). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and grey literature sources through August 2025. Primary outcomes included postoperative dysphagia, proton pump inhibitor use, and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes encompassed reoperation rates, operative time, length of stay, and conversion to open surgery. Risk ratios and mean differences were calculated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Four randomized controlled trials involving 160 patients (79 robotic, 81 conventional laparoscopic) met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were observed in early dysphagia (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.45-2.45), postoperative proton pump inhibitor use (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.25-3.79), or intraoperative complications (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.07-2.81). Secondary outcomes showed no differences in reoperation rates (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40-6.90), length of hospital stay (MD -0.03 days, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.36), or conversion rates (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.19-7.99). Operative time demonstrated substantial heterogeneity; sensitivity analysis revealed significantly longer times with robotics when one outlier study was removed (MD 40.28 min, p < 0.00001). Da Vinci robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication achieve equivalent clinical outcomes with no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes, complications, or long-term effectiveness, while robotic procedures consistently require longer operative times and substantially higher costs without demonstrable clinical benefits. These findings question the routine application of robotic platforms in antireflux surgery until cost-effectiveness and operative efficiency are optimized.",

Pooled results were calculated using risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% CI (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024621638). RESULTS: Four RCTs with 419 patients were included. Clinical success (Eckardt score ≤3) showed no significant difference between short and long myotomy (97.4% vs. 95.9%, RR: 1.02 with 95% CI: 0.98-1.06, P =0.33), Reflux symptoms (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.60-1.47, P =0.77), and reflux esophagitis (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.55-1.27, P =0.39). However, short myotomy significantly reduced pathologic acid exposure (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.91, P =0.02), procedural time (MD: -16.61 min, 95% CI: -26.40 to -6.81, P <0.001), and hospital stay (MD: -2.37 d, 95% CI: -4.67 to -0.06, P =0.04). Intraprocedural complications were similar ( P =0.73), as was integrated relaxation pressure ( P =0.95), indicating similar postoperative esophageal function. CONCLUSION: Short myotomy reduced acid exposure, procedure time, and hospital stay in POEM for achalasia without compromising clinical success or symptom improvement. It shows potential as an effective treatment, but large-scale RCTs are needed for definitive clinical endorsement.",

This systematic review evaluated the health effects of DB interventions in adults based on RCT evidence. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched through January 2025 for RCTs comparing DB to control conditions in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2). A narrative synthesis was performed due to substantial heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: We included 48 RCTs. DB protocols were highly heterogeneous, with parameters varying widely in breathing frequency (2-10 breaths/min), session duration (3-45 min), and total duration (single session to 12 weeks). Methodological quality was a significant concern (only 2.12 % of outcomes low risk of bias). Consistent benefits were found for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (including reduced medication use), anxiety, post-COVID-19 syndrome, and gestational diabetes). In healthy adults, DB showed acute cardiovascular benefits. However, evidence was inconsistent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and DB was less effective than standard care after cardiac surgery. Safety was underreported (18.75 % of studies), but no serious adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: DB is a promising complementary therapy for specific conditions, including GERD, but the evidence base is constrained by methodologically weak and heterogeneous primary studies. Future research requires rigorous, standardized trial designs to establish its clinical value. Despite these limitations, DB is a low-cost, accessible, and apparently safe intervention for select conditions.",

METHODS: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) asked: What is the efficacy of treatment compared with usual care for cough severity, cough frequency, and cough-related quality of life in patients with UCC? Studies of adults and adolescents aged > 12 years with a chronic cough of > 8 weeks' duration that was unexplained after systematic investigation and treatment were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the American College of Chest Physicians organization methodology. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs and five systematic reviews were included. The 11 RCTs reported data on 570 participants with chronic cough who received a variety of interventions. Study quality was high in 10 RCTs. The studies used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify UCC. Although gabapentin and morphine exhibited positive effects on cough-related quality of life, only gabapentin was supported as a treatment recommendation. Studies of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were affected by intervention fidelity bias; when this factor was addressed, ICS were found to be ineffective for UCC. Esomeprazole was ineffective for UCC without features of gastroesophageal acid reflux. Studies addressing nonacid gastroesophageal reflux disease were not identified. A multimodality speech pathology intervention improved cough severity. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supporting the diagnosis and management of UCC is limited. UCC requires further study to establish agreed terminology and the optimal methods of investigation using established criteria for intervention fidelity. Speech pathology-based cough suppression is suggested as a treatment option for UCC. This guideline presents suggestions for diagnosis and treatment based on the best available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future research.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to clarify the current management of GERD in children after EA repair, reporting the prevalence of GERD, indications, and effectiveness of medical and surgical therapies.A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane Database, and Web of Science. Studies involving patients under 18 years old with GERD following EA repair were included. Data were extracted on incidence, diagnostic approach, medical and surgical management, and outcomes.Out of 1,612 articles, 49 (5,613 patients) were included. Reporting diagnostic modality, pH-impedance was most frequently used. The pooled GERD incidence was 36.7% overall and 58.1% in type A/B EA. Postoperative anti-reflux medication was reported in 88% of patients; 53.8% of children receiving medical therapy subsequently required further procedures (anti-reflux surgery [ARS], feeding stoma, or total esophago-gastric dissociation). ARS was more common in type A/B than in type C/D cohorts. Resolution of symptoms after ARS was reported in 74.5% of patients. Complications following ARS occurred in 28.3%, with a 14.9% rate of redo fundoplication, and the highest incidence occurred in infants < 6 months. The data on timing and type of ARS were heterogeneous.GERD affected over one-third of EA patients, with higher prevalence in types A and B. Although proton pump inhibitor therapy is common, a large proportion required ARS, with higher complication rates in smaller children. These findings highlight the need for standardized diagnostic criteria and multicenter prospective registries with long-term follow-up to clarify optimal timing and technique.",

Effective intervention is crucial to prevent symptom relapse and long-term morbidity. This systematic review, conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with additional manual reference screening, included 33 studies encompassing 6,167 patients. 27 studies were retrospective cohort analyses evaluating anti-reflux surgery (ARS) outcomes and complications, while a few assessed GERD prevalence and risk factors influencing ARS success or failure. GERD prevalence in EA patients ranges from 25 to 80%, with uncertain long-term efficacy of medical therapy and dietary modifications. Fundoplication, previously performed routinely, is now selectively recommended following a multidisciplinary evaluation to differentiate GERD from alternative causes such as esophageal dysmotility, aspiration, or recurrent fistulas. Approximately 40% of EA patients require ARS, yet failure rates range from 7.8% to 47%. Identified risk factors for failure include male sex, prior abdominal surgery, long-gap EA, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Laparoscopic fundoplication, though increasingly adopted, has higher failure rates than open Nissen fundoplication in complex cases. Despite surgical intervention, GERD recurrence remains a concern, necessitating long-term surveillance. While open Nissen fundoplication remains the gold standard, persistent symptoms highlight the need for large-scale, randomized controlled trials to refine GERD management and optimize surgical decision-making in this high-risk population.",

While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first-line treatment, only about one-third of patients achieve adequate symptom control. Alginate-based medications in combination with PPIs have shown promise, but the comparative effectiveness of generic versus original alginates remains unexplored. To compare the effectiveness of generic alginate (ONE GERD) versus original alginate (Gaviscon Dual Action Suspension) in combination with PPIs for treating GERD symptoms in patients who failed standard PPI therapy.This multicenter prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority trial included 48 patients who failed standard-dose PPI treatment. Patients were randomized to receive either generic or original alginate four times daily for 28 days. Treatment response was evaluated using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) at days 7 and 28. At day 7, both groups showed identical response rates of 45.83%. By day 28, response rates increased to 54.17% for generic alginate and 70.83% for original alginate (p = 0.23). Total RDQ scores and symptom-free rates showed no significant differences between groups at both time points. Adverse event rates were comparable (16.67% vs. 8.33%, p = 0.66). Analysis of specific symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, and regurgitation) revealed similar improvements in both groups throughout the study period. This study provides evidence supporting the therapeutic equivalence of the generic alginate (ONE GERD) to the original formulation (Gaviscon Dual Action Suspension) in treating symptoms for patients with GERD who have failed PPI therapy. Crucially, the comparable efficacy and safety, coupled with the inherent lower cost of generic medications, suggest significant economic benefits and the potential for wider patient access to effective GERD management. This makes generic alginate a viable and attractive alternative in clinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings or for patients facing financial constraints, thereby contributing to more equitable healthcare solutions without compromising therapeutic outcomes.",

While short-term outcomes have been widely studied, evidence on long-term efficacy and safety remains limited and heterogeneous. This meta-analysis aimed to compare long-term clinical outcomes between POEM and LHM. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 15th August 2025. Studies were included if they directly compared POEM with LHM, reported outcomes with ≥2 years of follow-up, and provided data on operative time, length of hospital stay, functional outcomes, or reflux-related outcomes. Pooled mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 1158 patients (POEM = 609; LHM = 549) were included, comprising nine unique studies and one follow-up publication. POEM was associated with significantly shorter operative time (MD: -31.65 minutes, 95% CI: -46.39 to -16.92, P < 0.001) and shorter hospital stay (MD: -0.78 days, 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.52, P < 0.001). Functional outcomes, including dysphagia scores (MD: -0.24, 95% CI: -0.62 to 0.15, P = 0.23), postoperative Eckardt scores (MD: 0.11, 95% CI: -0.38 to 0.60, P = 0.65), and treatment success rates (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.96 to 2.13, P = 0.08), were comparable between POEM and LHM at both 2-5 years and ≥ 5 years. Reflux-related outcomes, including RSI, GERD-HRQL, GERD symptoms, heartburn resolution, and incidence of esophagitis, did not significantly differ between groups. However, continued postoperative proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was significantly more frequent after POEM (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.78, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Both POEM and LHM provide durable long-term relief of achalasia symptoms with comparable efficacy and reflux-related outcomes. POEM offers advantages in shorter operative time and hospital stay but is associated with a higher need for long-term PPI therapy. These findings support POEM as an effective long-term alternative to LHM, though further randomized studies with extended follow-up are warranted.",

The association of GORD with CRS is systematically assessed from the medical literature. METHODOLOGY: Embase and MEDLINE were searched using a comprehensive strategy limited to English language and Human subjects. Any study with original data on the experimental, diagnostic, treatment or prognostic association of CRS with GORD was included. Studies without a control group, case reports and review articles were excluded. RESULTS: The search returned 958 records, with an additional 10 found from bibliographic lists; this produced 32 studies. The included studies (n=32) consisted of studies reporting pathogenic factors (n=20), epidemiological association (n=8), prognostic interactions (n=3), and a combination of these outcomes (n=1). Potential pathogenic roles for GORD in CRS were supported; CRS subjects had greater prevalence of intranasal Helicobacter pylori and acid reflux than subjects without CRS. CRS is more prevalent in GORD sufferers than those without GORD. Evidence is conflicting for GORD as a factor in CRS treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The results support a significant association of GORD with CRS. Physicians should be cognizant of the potential for acid and non-acid reflux as a driving factor in CRS.",

METHODS: The economic evaluation was carried out using data from a double-blind, randomised control trial. Costs were measured in pounds sterling. Effectiveness was assessed on a binary scale, resolution versus non-resolution of disease, after 32 weeks. RESULTS: The primary analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3421.27 per resolution. After applying quality-adjusted life year (QALY) data from the REFLUX trial (2008), we derived an ICER/QALY of £34 747.32, marginally exceeding the £30 000 threshold set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. However, further subgroup analysis showed cost-effectiveness when healing severe grades of oesophagitis (ICER/QALY of £22 165.56). The first sensitivity analysis considers the typically non-invasive determination of disease resolution; the ICER/QALY of £15 826.98 supports vonoprazan's use in treating severe oesophagitis. The second considers a longer healing phase alongside a stronger 30 mg maintenance dose of lansoprazole, concordant with current guidelines; the ICER/QALY of £43 998.39 suggests the guidelines (regarding dosage, frequency and duration) must be optimised for vonoprazan. The final sensitivity analysis accounts for variations in quality-of-life measures, which grossly inflate the ICER/QALY (£118 216.32); this emphasises that vonoprazan should mainly be considered for patients with persistent symptoms and high severity. CONCLUSION: Vonoprazan is potentially cost-effective for the initial healing of severe oesophagitis, after endoscopic diagnosis. Further trials and economic evaluations are necessary for the symptom-based prescription of vonoprazan and to determine the optimal dosage, frequency and duration.",

We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of 8 treatments for idiopathic achalasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Three major bibliographic databases were reviewed for enrollment of randomized controlled trials between January 2000 and June 2021. We included adults with idiopathic achalasia and compared two or more of eight interventions including botulinum toxin injection (BTI), pneumatic dilation (PD), BTI + PD, LHM without fundoplication, LHM followed with Dor or Toupet fundoplication, and POEM using either the anterior or posterior approach. Our focus was on clinical success rate, postsurgical acid reflux, and moderate-to-severe adverse events. RESULTS: : Twenty-four studies involved a total of 1987 participants for analysis. When compared with PD, POEM with anterior approach, POEM with posterior approach, LHM + Toupet, and LHM + Dor were all significantly superior to the other regimens in short-term efficacy, with POEM with anterior approach and LHM + Dor showing better improvement in mid-term efficacy. BTI showed a significantly lower efficacy than PD in both periods. Regarding safety, only LHM without fundoplication was significantly associated with higher acid reflux than PD, while LHM + Toupet, LHM without fundoplication, and LHM + Dor showed a non-significant increase in moderate-to-severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: : For idiopathic achalasia, we suggest that POEM with an anterior or posterior approach and LHM with Dor or Toupet fundoplication be initially recommended. On the contrary, both LHM without fundoplication and BTI are not recommended as definitive therapy.",

Its treatment includes hygienic-dietary changes, use of medications and, in selected cases, surgery with laparos-copic hiatoplasty and Nissen total fundoplication. However, this last treatment modality presents risks of postoperative dysphagia. High Resolution Esophageal Manometry (HREM) has been considered the test of choice for identifying patients who are candidates for surgical treatment at an increased risk of developing dysphagia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to carry out a systematic review to evaluate the clinical and manometric factors that predict post-hiatoplasty and Nissen fundoplication dysphagia using HREM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Having defined the search engine, we used the databases MEDLINE, PUBMED, EBSCOHOST, SCOPUS and EMBASE. 2147 articles were identified. After selection, 11 studies remained. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the data from the selected articles are heterogeneous, but there is agreement regarding a higher risk of dysphagia among female patients, patients with dysphagia present in the preoperative period and, about manometric parameters, for patients with dysphagia in the preoperative period, there is a higher incidence of dysphagia resolution for patients with DCI >1000 mmHg.s.cm. In patients with ineffective esophageal motility, it is recommended to perform the Rapid Multiple Swallowing Test to assess the contractile reserve of the eso-phageal body. If there is an increase in contractile strength with this test, it is considered safe to perform a total fundoplication because the incidence of late dysphagia is low in these cases. CONTEXTO:: A Doença do refluxo gastroesofágico tem prevalência de 12% na população brasileira. Seu tratamento inclui mudança higieno-dietéticas, uso de medicamentos e, em casos selecionados, a cirurgia com hiatoplastia e fundoplicatura total videolaparoscópica à Nissen. No entanto, esta última modalidade de tratamento apresenta riscos de disfagia no pós-operatório. A manometria esofágica de alta resolução (MEAR) tem sido colocada como o exame de escolha para identificação de paciente candidatos ao tratamento cirúrgico com risco aumentado de desenvolver disfagia. OBJETIVO:: O objetivo deste estudo é a realização de uma revisão sistemática para avaliar os fatores clínicos e manométricos preditores de disfagia pós-hiatoplastia e fundoplicatura mediante utilização da MEAR. MÉTODOS E RESULTADOS:: Definido o mecanismo de busca, utilizamos das bases MEDLINE, PUBMED, EBSCOHOST, SCOPUS e EMBASE. Fora identificados 2147 artigos e, após seleção, restaram 11 estudos. CONCLUSÃO:: Concluímos que os dados advindos dos artigos selecionados são heterogêneos, porém há concordância quanto a mais risco de disfagia dentre pacientes femininas, pacientes com disfagia presente no pré-operatório e, quanto aos parâmetros manométricos, para os pacientes com disfagia no pré-operatório, tem-se maior incidência de resolução da disfagia para paciente com DCI >1000 mmHg.s.cm. Nos pacientes portadores de motilidade esofagiana ineficaz, recomenda-se a realização do teste de múltiplas deglutições rápidas para se avaliar a reserva contrátil do corpo esofágico. Caso haja aumento da força contrátil com o referido teste, é considerado segura a realização de fundoplicatura total já que nestes casos é baixa a incidência de disfagia tardia.",

Tegoprazan demonstrated noninferior healing rates at 4 weeks [relative risk (RR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-1.16; P  = 0.28; I ² = 51%] and 8 weeks (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96-1.06; P  = 0.73; I ² = 0%) compared to PPIs. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall incidence of adverse events or SAEs (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.92-1.53; P  = 0.19; I ² = 24%). However, a significantly higher rate of drug-related TEAEs was observed in the tegoprazan group (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03-1.48; P  = 0.02; I ² = 0%). In conclusion, tegoprazan is an effective treatment option for EE, with comparable efficacy to PPIs, though further studies are warranted to evaluate its long-term safety before routine clinical use.",

We analyzed data from a clinical trial evaluating the effect of ranitidine plus antacid on heartburn severity in GERD patients. After 26 subjects ingested a standard meal and received either placebo or ranitidine-antacid, heartburn severity (assessed via a visual analog scale), esophageal pH, and gastric pH were measured at 15-min intervals. Two phenotypes emerged based on heartburn severity patterns: \"Persistent Heartburn\" (PH), characterized by sustained high severity, and \"Non-persistent Heartburn\" (NPH), where severity peaked and then declined. PH subjects had similar gastric acidity but higher overall heartburn severity and lower esophageal acid exposure than NPH subjects. Both phenotypes exhibited esophageal hyperalgesia, with significant heartburn even at esophageal pH above 4.0, and hyperalgesia was more pronounced in PH subjects. These findings suggest that esophageal sensitivity, rather than acid exposure alone, contributes to symptom severity. The differing responses to placebo and ranitidine-antacid highlight potential mechanisms underlying treatment failure in some GERD patients, emphasizing the need for tailored therapeutic approaches.",

Although effective in the short term, it has a high insufficient clinical response rate, leading to weight regain and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), necessitating revisional surgery. The two primary options for conversion procedures are the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), considered the gold standard, and the one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), recognized for its simplicity and metabolic benefits. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of RYGB and OAGB as revisional procedures after insufficient clinical response to SG in terms of weight loss, metabolic improvements, surgical complications, and operative time. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Ovid/Medline, and Embase). Out of 236 identified studies, five met the inclusion criteria. Data were analyzed using relative risk (RR) for categorical variables and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, applying a random-effects model. RESULTS: OAGB showed a statistically significant advantage in total weight loss percentage (TWL%) compared to RYGB (MD, - 1.24; 95% CI, - 1.94, - 0.53; p = 0.0006). However, no significant difference was observed in BMI reduction (MD, 0.00; 95% CI, - 1.24, 1.24; p = 1.00). Both techniques demonstrated similar remission rates for hypertension (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.60-1.22; p = 0.38), GERD (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86-1.17; p = 0.97), and type 2 diabetes (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.21; p = 0.81). Postoperative complications were comparable between groups (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.67-1.18; p = 0.42). However, operative time was significantly shorter in OAGB (MD, 30.10 min; 95% CI, 27.89, 32.32; p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: OAGB demonstrated greater total weight loss and a shorter operative time compared to RYGB, with a comparable safety profile. Both techniques were equally effective in managing hypertension and GERD, though OAGB showed a non-significant trend favoring type 2 diabetes remission. RYGB may be preferable for patients with severe GERD. Further high-quality, long-term studies are needed to establish the optimal revisional procedure for SG.",

METHODOLOGY: This study was a randomized controlled trial. 98 proton pump inhibitor -dependent gastroesophageal reflux disease patients who underwent aparoscopic fundoplication in our hospital from Jan 2020 to Dec 2022 were randomly divided into two groups using a random number table. Group A (n=49) received multi-perspective nursing based on the gastroesophageal reflux disease concept in addition to routine nursing intervention, while Group B (n=49) received only routine aparoscopic fundoplication perioperative nursing intervention. The groups were compared in terms of first postoperative anal exhaust time, feeding time, time out of bed, hospital stay, Visual Analogue Scale scores before and after surgery, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Hamilton Depression Scale scores, nursing satisfaction, and complications. RESULTS: Group A showed significant improvements in various postoperative outcomes compared to Group B, including shorter anal exhaust time, feeding time, time out of bed, and hospital stay (P<0.05). Group A also had lower VAS pain scores, lower Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Hamilton Depression Scale scores, and higher nursing satisfaction scores than Group B (P<0.05).

Peroral endoscopic cardial constriction (PECC), antireflux mucosal intervention (ARMI), and radiofrequency ablation (RF) possess analogous antireflux mechanisms. This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and effectiveness of antireflux therapy during endoscopic cardia peripheral tissue scar formation (ECSF) procedures. We comprehensively searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wan-Fang databases for articles published from January 1990 to January 2024. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to assess the outcomes, with outcome metrics including the Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (GERD-Q) score, proton pump inhibitor discontinuation rate, pH <4.2 percent acid reflux time (AET), lower esophageal pressure (LES pressure), DeMeester score, adverse events, and patient satisfaction. Twenty studies involving 1219 patients were included. PECC was significantly superior to RF in lowering the patients' postoperative GERD-Q scores(MD = -2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): [-3.02, -1.66]), augmentation of LES pressures(MD = 3.22, 95% CI: [1.21, 5.23]), and having a lower incidence of serious adverse events. ARMI was preferable to PECC (MD = -2.87, 95% CI [-4.23, -1.51])and RF (MD = -1.12, 95% CI [-1.79, -0.54]) in reducing the AET percentage, but was not as effective as PECC in lowering GERD-Q scores(MD = -1.50, 95% CI [-2.47, -0.53]). The incidence of adverse effects was less than 10% for all interventions, with most of them mildly self-resolving. Each ECSF procedure resulted in a favorable outcome in patients with GERD. Considering the safety and efficacy of treatment, PECC was the most favorable choice among ECSF procedures.",

While PPI-related adverse events (AEs) are well-documented, safety data on P-CABs remain limited. This study systematically reviewed AEs of P-CABs compared with PPIs, with a meta-analysis focusing on hypergastrinemia. METHODS: Following a preregistered PROSPERO protocol (CRD42024565011), we searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing P-CABs and PPIs in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer disease. Frequently reported AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were qualitatively synthesized; hypergastrinemia was quantitatively analyzed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten RCTs and one observational study were included. Nine studies reported specific AEs, with diarrhea reported in seven studies and constipation, nasopharyngitis, and liver-related events, each reported in three. Most AEs had reporting rates below 5%, except diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract inflammation, which exceeded 5% in both groups. Fracture demonstrated the largest relative difference between the groups, with a threefold higher rate in the P-CAB group. SAEs were observed in fewer than 10% of patients in both groups in most studies. A meta-analysis of six studies showed greater serum gastrin elevation in the P-CAB group compared with the PPI group (mean difference: 130.92 pg/mL, 95% confidence intervals: 36.37-225.47). CONCLUSIONS: P-CABs demonstrate a comparable AE risk to PPIs but monitoring for hypergastrinemia and hepatic dysfunction is essential. Further research is required to support safer clinical use.",

RECENT FINDINGS: PubMed.gov, Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched through March 15, 2024. Studies comparing characteristics of patients with endoscopically diagnosed BE or EAC to control groups satisfied our inclusion criteria. Dual extraction provided data for random-effects meta-analyses. Sufficient data were extracted from 54 included studies to perform our meta-analyses. There were five risk factors with significant associations for the development of BE: symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux at least once weekly (OR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.03-6.25; p = 0.004) tobacco smoking (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.30-1.51; p < 0.001); alcohol use (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.71; p = 0.008); male gender (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.19-1.57; p < 0.001); and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m CONCLUSION: Five risk factors showed significant associations with the development of BE and one with the development of EAC, with over a three-fold increase in BE for patients with gastroesophageal reflux more than once weekly.

This trial aimed to compare the efficacy of acupuncture combined with standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy versus high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for treatment-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 72 adults with persistent gastroesophageal reflux symptoms despite once-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy were randomized to receive either acupuncture plus standard-dose omeprazole or double-dose omeprazole for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in reflux symptoms assessed with the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire, and the secondary outcome was the quality of life measured by the Short Form-36 questionnaire. Both groups showed significant improvement in symptom burden and quality of life. Acupuncture was associated with a greater reduction in heartburn (p = 0.026) and an improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001), while high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy demonstrated more favorable effects on regurgitation (p = 0.001) and sleep disturbance (p < 0.001). A clinically meaningful reduction in total reflux score was observed in both groups without significant between-group differences. Adverse events were mild and transient, with no serious complications reported. Acupuncture combined with standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy provides clinical benefits comparable to high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy, with favorable effects on quality of life and symptom control. These findings support acupuncture as a safe, patient-centered alternative for managing resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia (HH) are notable causes. The release of cytokines near the damaged esophagus may promote atrial fibrillation (AF). Hiatal hernia may lead to anatomical block and arrhythmias. Our systematic review aims to investigate the relationship between treatment of GERD/HH and improvement/resolution of arrhythmias.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Databases including PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched from January 2005 to February 2024 using specific terms. Two co-authors screened and reviewed records. Exclusion criteria included cases without post-treatment information and conference abstracts. All study types discussing the relationship between GERD/ HH and arrhythmias were included. Data on patient characteristics, arrhythmia types, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Murad checklist was utilized for quality assessment.Results13 studies in the review included 11 case reports, 1 case series, and 1 pilot study. Hiatal hernia repair (HHR) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) resolved arrhythmias in case reports and the case series. Proton pump inhibitor treatment for reflux esophagitis reduced AF symptoms in the pilot study. Arrhythmia resolution usually occurred shortly after treatment began. Patients were mostly around 59-62 years old, with more males. Hypertension and esophagitis were common comorbidities. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) was the most frequent arrhythmia type. Antiarrhythmic medication was stopped in some cases, and anticoagulation varied.ConclusionHiatal hernia and GERD may contribute to arrhythmias, and early management with surgery and PPIs shows promise in resolving symptoms and reducing medication reliance.",

This study compares the efficacy of adding a wedge pillow versus an evening PPI to the morning PPI for treating nocturnal reflux symptoms. METHODS: This noninferiority randomized trial included patients with ≥ 2/week nocturnal heartburn/regurgitation despite morning PPI use for ≥ 4 weeks. Participants were randomized to either a wedge pillow with morning or twice-daily PPI for 4 weeks. Nocturnal reflux symptoms were assessed using the nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease symptom severity and impact questionnaire (NGSSIQ) at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, along with quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality. Twenty-four hour pH-impedance monitoring was conducted at baseline and Week 4. Wedge pillow compliance was monitored with a pressure-sensing timekeeper. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled with comparable baseline characteristics and severity of nocturnal reflux. At Week 4, NGSSIQ scores were 30.01 ± 1.97 in the wedge pillow group and 36.33 ± 1.96 in the twice-daily PPI group (mean difference - 6.32; 95% CI -10.28 to 6.21), which falls below the predefined non-inferiority margin demonstrating non-inferiority. Sleep quality was better in the pillow group (5.55 ± 0.56 vs. 7.53 ± 0.60, p = 0.001). Although nighttime median bolus contact time was longer in the twice-daily PPI group [4.3 (2.9-5.4) vs. 7.4 (3.5-15.5) seconds, p = 0.03], other reflux parameters did not show clinically relevant differences between groups. Pillow compliance was high, with 83.3% reporting satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Adding a wedge pillow was not inferior to evening PPI for nocturnal reflux symptoms and was associated with greater improvements in sleep quality, despite the absence of clinically relevant differences in reflux parameters, supporting the wedge pillow as a potential alternative for managing nocturnal reflux symptoms.

METHODS: This prospective randomized study recruited patients with typical reflux symptoms and reflux esophagitis on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (NCT02934152). Patients positive for H. pylori via a urea breath test (UBT) were randomly assigned to receive bacterial eradication with triple therapy for 2 weeks either before or after proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment for 4 weeks. Follow-up was implemented with serial GerdQ evaluation and a subsequent UBT. The primary outcome was the incidence rates of symptom rebound between patients with and without H. pylori infection. The secondary outcomes included the severity of symptom rebound, incidence rates of symptom rebound, and successful eradication rates between the early and late eradication groups. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were enrolled, of whom 107 (43.1%) tested positive for H. pylori infection. All patients with and without concurrent H. pylori infection had significant symptom improvement over the entire treatment. Patients with H. pylori infection had significantly lower rates of symptom rebound (19.8% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.034) and rebound severity (1.8 ± 0.7 vs. 2.8 ± 1.6, p = 0.031) 4 weeks after eradication and PPI treatment than those without. The incidence rates of symptom rebound and successful eradication rates were not significantly different between the early and late eradication groups.

This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate whether adding cruroplasty to LSG (Cr-LSG) improves postoperative GERD symptom control in patients with intraoperative evidence of hiatal laxity. METHODS: A total of 100 patients undergoing LSG were randomized to either standard LSG or LSG with posterior cruroplasty (Cr-LSG). Patients with large hiatal hernias were excluded. GERD symptoms were assessed using the validated GERD-Health Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. BMI changes were also recorded. Statistical analysis included mixed-design ANOVA for within- and between-group comparisons. RESULTS: Of the 100 enrolled patients, 95 (95%) completed the 6-month follow-up (LSG: 47, Cr-LSG: 48). Both groups demonstrated significant BMI reductions over time, with no between-group differences. GERD symptoms improved significantly within both groups postoperatively. However, between-group comparisons showed significantly lower GERD-HRQL scores in the Cr-LSG group at both 3 and 6 months (p < 0.05), suggesting better symptom control. Postoperative PPI use was not systematically recorded and represents a limitation. CONCLUSION: Adding cruroplasty to LSG may enhance short-term reflux symptom control in selected patients with intraoperative hiatal laxity. However, given the study's reliance on subjective symptom reporting and limited follow-up, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further studies using objective diagnostics and longer-term follow-up are warranted.",

This umbrella review aims to consolidate current meta-analyses, providing a comprehensive evaluation of treatment efficacy across various methodologies. By employing statistical analyses and concise quality assessment, we seek to standardize outcomes and effectively highlight the limitations inherent in existing research. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 5 international databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses focused on achalasia treatments. Key parameters evaluated included clinical success rates, complications, operation times, and lengths of hospital stay. Statistical synthesis was employed to compare treatment effectiveness across studies. RESULTS: The initial search identified 1037 records, of which 23 meta-analysis studies were included in this study. This review suggests that peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) may be comparable to, or potentially more effective than, Heller myotomy in the short-term management of achalasia. However, this was not further supported in longer follow-up durations. While POEM offers advantages such as shorter hospital stays, the ability to perform longer myotomies, and reduced operative duration, it demonstrated a greater risk of gastroesophageal reflux. However, the existing data are insufficiently conclusive, underscoring the need for additional long-term, high-quality studies to validate these results. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the comparable efficacy and safety of POEM and Heller myotomy in the treatment of achalasia. The variability in study quality and the presence of methodological flaws in the conducted studies underlines the need for further long-term research, improved methodological rigor, and standardized treatment protocols to optimize patient management in achalasia.",

METHODS: A systematic search identified 37 studies (11 comparative and 26 single-arm studies) evaluating ARMIs. Outcomes included GERD symptom scores (GERD-Q, GERD-HRQL), DeMeester score, acid exposure time (AET), complete cessation of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and adverse events (AEs). Random-effects models pooled standardized mean differences and risk ratios (RRs). Subgroup analyses compared techniques (endoscopic mucosal resection [EMR], endoscopic submucosal dissection [ESD], anti-reflux mucosal ablation [ARMA]). RESULTS: Technical success was 100%, with a mean procedure time of 42.09 min. ARMIs significantly reduced the proportion of patients using PPI (RR = 2.22-3.06; <3-24 months; p ≤ 0.001) and improved GERD-Q, GERD-HRQL, and DeMeester scores through 36 months (p < 0.05). AET decreased at 3-6 months (p < 0.001). Overall AEs occurred in 13% of cases (bleeding: 3%; stricture: 8%; dysphagia: 8%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated efficacy across EMR, ESD, and ARMA subtypes (p < 0.05), though AE rates differed. Compared to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF), ARMIs showed similar symptom relief (p > 0.05), shorter procedures (p < 0.001), and lower dysphagia (X% vs. Y%; p = 0.01). Versus Stretta, ARMIs had similar PPI discontinuation rates (p = 0.258) and GERD-Q improvement (p = 0.696). CONCLUSION: ARMIs offer durable symptom control with reduced PPI dependency. Preliminary comparative data suggest potential efficacy/safety advantages over LNF/Stretta, warranting randomized trials. Technique selection should balance efficacy and AE profiles.",

Gut microbes have been recognized as key regulators of energy utilization and gastrointestinal health. In this study, we investigated the effects of probiotics Lactobacillus plantarum strain GKM3 on overweight and obese subjects in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Participants, aged 20-40 with body mass index between 25.0 and 29.9 and body fat percentages over 25 % for males and 30 % for females, were divided into a placebo group (n = 19) and a probioitcs group (n = 40), receiving capsules containing either a placebo or the probiotics GKM3 for four weeks. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that supplementation with strain GKM3 at 1 g per day over the 4-week period significantly increased bowel movement frequency and alleviated symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. Fecal lipid analysis revealed elevated levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol compared to the placebo group. Microbiota analysis showed a significant reduction in obesity-associated taxa (Alcaligenaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Acidaminococcus, Fusobacterium, and Megamonas) and an increase in beneficial genera (Akkermansia and Lactobacillus) following probiotic intervention. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the strain GKM3 modulates gut flora, leading to reduced fat absorption and improved gastrointestinal functions in overweight and obese individuals.",

Predictors of recurrence and adverse events remain understudied and inconsistently reported. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors of recurrence and adverse events in EFI. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library on March 1, 2025. We included any observational studies or clinical trials that evaluated EFI outcomes in adults. The primary outcomes were EFI recurrence and adverse events, assessed according to underlying esophageal pathology, biopsy practices, follow-up, and timing of endoscopy. Effect sizes were evaluated using odds ratios (ORs), and a random-effects model was applied. A total of 14 studies were included with 3116 patients. Male gender was modestly associated with a higher risk of EFI recurrence (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.01-2.10; P = 0.05), and patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) had a markedly increased risk of recurrence (OR 3.28; 95% CI 2.09-5.14; P < 0.001). No significant associations with recurrence were observed for biopsy (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.98-2.11; P = 0.06), those who underwent follow-up (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.37-3.32; P = 0.74), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (OR 1.22; 95% CI 0.46-3.23; P = 0.68), or hiatal hernia (OR 1.84; 95% CI 0.51-6.65, P = 0.35).

Similarly, gender, EoE, and GERD were not associated with increased risk of adverse events. Only the male gender and EoE were significantly associated with a higher risk of EFI recurrence. Other factors, including GERD, hiatal hernia, follow-up, and biopsy status, were not. Delayed endoscopy and prior EFI were not associated with increased adverse events. Large-scale studies are needed to define risk factors better and strengthen the risk-stratification guide for preventive strategies.",

METHODS: From 2020 to 2023, infants ≤ 6 months old with laryngomalacia at a tertiary children's hospital were randomized to famotidine and feeding modifications (AST) or feeding modifications alone (no-AST). Laryngomalacia Airway Symptom Score (LASS) and Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (I-GERQ-R) were completed by guardians. Of 343 patients approached, 257 were excluded due to severe laryngomalacia on LASS, severe GER (I-GERQ-R ≥ 16), prior AST, no laryngomalacia on laryngoscopy, recommendation for supraglottoplasty, and/or other airway anomalies. Twenty-one declined participation. LASS and I-GERQ-R were again completed 1-6 months following enrollment. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients enrolled; 40/65 (62%) followed up at a mean of 3.1 months (SD 1.4 months). Of these 40, 10 (25%) had mild and 30 (75%) had moderate laryngomalacia. Median I-GERQ-R was 11 (range 5-15) at the initial appointment and 7.5 (range 0-26) at follow-up (p = 0.002). Laryngomalacia resolved in 13/40 (33%) at follow-up based on LASS (p < 0.001). Patients randomized to AST (n = 20) and no-AST (n = 20) had comparable improvement on LASS (p = 0.3) and I-GERQ-R (p = 0.8).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the esophageal mucosa. These changes lead to symptoms such as dysphagia, food impaction, and abdominal pain. Although less common, eosinophilic gastritis (EoG) shares similar inflammatory mechanisms but has fewer randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting treatment efficacy. Conventional treatments often fail to achieve histologic remission, whereas biological therapies targeting type 2 (T2) inflammation show promising results. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies in EoE, with a systematic review of EoG studies. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PRISMA guidelines to assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies in EoE and EoG. Thorough searches were conducted across PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase up to June 2025. Primary outcomes were changed in Peak Eosinophilic Count, and secondary outcomes were endoscopic reference score (EREFS), overall adverse events, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Eight RCTs having 865 participants with EoE, treated with 6 monoclonal antibodies, were included in the meta-analysis, and 3 additional RCTs (155 participants) with EoG were included in the systematic review but not the meta-analysis. Quality assessment using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool showed overall low risk of bias. Monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced peak eosinophil count, MD was -59.17 [95% CI: (-88.88, -29.45)], and improved EREFS. Dupilimab showed the strongest efficacy among the 6 antibodies evaluated, and the adverse events were comparable to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal antibodies, particularly dupilumab, demonstrate efficacy in reducing peak eosinophil count and improving EREFS in EoE, with a favorable safety profile. Although the systematic review of EoG studies suggests similar trends, the limited number of RCTs precludes conducting a meta-analysis. Small sample sizes, lack of patient-reported outcomes, and high heterogeneity highlight the need for larger, standardized trials to confirm these findings and to assess long-term effects.",

METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted, and it followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. A literature search was performed systematically in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science on February 1, 2025. The protocol of this meta-analysis was published in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42025650118. RESULTS: Eight studies involving a total of 11,356 patients were finally included. Systemic treatment combined with RT improved OS (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.70-0.74, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.62-0.78, P < 0.001) compared with systemic treatment alone. The grade ≥ 3 treatment-related lymphopenia (OR = 5.52, P < 0.001), leukopenia (OR = 1.56, P < 0.001), and esophagitis (OR = 13.11, P < 0.001) were more frequent in the RT-combined group; no significant differences were observed in other severe toxicities. Subgroup analysis on systemic treatment type, ESCC, and TNM stage edition also demonstrated that this RT-combined treatment could provide significant survival benefits. Exploratory analysis showed that maximal survival benefit emerged in patients who received systemic therapy, especially immunochemotherapy, combined with radical (≥ 50 Gy) primary tumor RT. CONCLUSIONS: By synthesizing data from both the pre-immunotherapy and immunotherapy eras involving 11,356 patients, we found that the incorporation of radical radiotherapy into first-line systemic treatment regimens improves survival outcomes while maintaining acceptable toxicity profiles in selected patients with advanced EC.Further randomized clinical trials are needed to verify our conclusions.",

Transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA), a noninvasive method of delivering electrical stimulation via surface electrodes placed at certain acupuncture points that are in the vicinity of peripheral nerves, has been reported to exert therapeutic effects in patients with gastroesophageal reflux, functional dyspepsia, and constipation. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential of TEA for diabetic gastroparesis. METHODS: Eighteen patients with diabetes were enrolled in a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized and crossover trial with TEA and sham-TEA. TEA was performed twice daily after lunch and dinner via acupoints, ST36 (below the kneecap in the vicinity of the peroneal, sciatic, and tibial nerves) and PC6 (wrist above the median nerve) for 4 weeks. A set of parameters previously reported to improve gastrointestinal motility was used for both TEA and sham-TEA (delivered via sham-points). The gastroparesis cardinal symptom index was used to assess symptoms. The electrogastrogram (EGG) was used to assess gastric pace-making activity (slow waves). KEY RESULTS: The TEA treatment improved each of the five major gastroparesis symptoms in comparison to baseline: nausea reduced by 29.7% (p = 0.005), retching by 31.1% (p = 0.006), vomiting by 39.3% (p = 0.005), abdominal fullness by 21.4% (p = 0.005), and bloating by 20.6% (p = 0.006). There was also a significant improvement in the \"pain interfering with activity\" score with the 4-week TEA treatment in comparison to baseline (p = 0.046). TEA improved gastric pace-making activity, reflected as a significant increase in the percentage of normal gastric slow waves in the postprandial state (69.5% ± 12.1% vs. 77.4% ± 16.5%, p = 0.039). Concurrently, TEA resulted in a trend of postprandial increase in vagal activity. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: TEA at acupuncture points ST36 and PC6 with appropriate parameters is effective in treating the major gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Further pivotal studies are warranted to determine its clinical efficacies.",

Traditional diagnostic methods rely on endoscopy with biopsy, which is invasive and resource-intensive. The recent advancements have focused on developing noninvasive and minimally invasive diagnostic tools to improve patient experience and facilitate disease monitoring. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate emerging noninvasive diagnostic techniques for EoE, including biomarkers, esophageal string tests (EST), and advanced imaging modalities, and their potential to complement or replace conventional diagnostic methods. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in major databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify studies investigating noninvasive diagnostic approaches for EoE. Inclusion criteria focused on original research and clinical trials evaluating diagnostic accuracy, patient acceptability, and clinical utility. Data on diagnostic methods, outcomes, and limitations were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Emerging diagnostic methods, such as blood and urine biomarkers (e.g., EDN, ECP, eotaxin-3), EST, and advanced imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography, EndoFLIP), demonstrated comparable sensitivity and specificity to endoscopic biopsy in detecting EoE. These tools offer advantages in reducing procedural burden, enabling dynamic disease monitoring, and enhancing patient adherence. However, challenges include variability in diagnostic thresholds and limited large-scale validation. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive diagnostic tools for EoE hold promise in transforming clinical practice by reducing reliance on invasive endoscopy. Further research is needed to standardize protocols and validate these methods for routine use.",

A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to obtain effect size-risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD)-with 95% confidence interval (CI) for different outcomes. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) was estimated to present the relative ranking of treatment. The primary outcome was the induction of symptomatic improvement. The secondary outcomes were endoscopic improvement and histological remission. Higher SUCRA curve rankings indicate a greater probability of superior treatment efficacy. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251155393). RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 409 records, of which 18 trials (total n = 2,506 patients) were eligible for inclusion. From 12 trials that assessed the induction of clinical improvement, Dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw) ranked first (SMD -0.57, 95%CI [-0.79, -0.35]), while Dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (q2w) ranked relatively low. From 12 randomized controlled trials evaluating endoscopic improvement, Dupilumab 300 mg qw (MD -2.10, 95%CI [-2.49,-1.90]) and 300 mg q2w (MD -1.87, 95%CI [-2.25, -1.48])ranked second and fourth, respectively. In 17 RCTs assessing the induction of histological remission, Budesonide orally disintegrating tablet (BODT) ranked highest(RR 30.77, 95%CI [6.63, 294.95]), whereas Dupilumab (qw/q2w) showed moderate effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Dupilumab 300mg qw might be the best performing agent for induction of clinical improvement (the primary endpoint) and BODT might be the most efficacious agents for histological and endoscopic improvement (the secondary endpoint). This could provide evidence for clinical therapy strategy for EoE patients.",

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: Three investigators searched the specified databases for studies investigating the relationship between LPR, GERD and recalcitrant CRS with or without polyposis. The following outcomes were investigated with PRISMA criteria: age; gender; reflux and CRS diagnosis; association outcomes and potential treatment outcomes. The authors performed a bias analysis of papers and provided recommendations for future studies. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies investigated the association between reflux and recalcitrant CRS. According to pharyngeal pH monitoring, 54% of patients with recalcitrant CRS reported hypo or nasopharyngeal acid reflux events. The number of hypo- and nasopharyngeal acid reflux events was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy individuals in 4 and 2 studies, respectively. Only one study did not report intergroup differences. The proportion of GERD was significantly higher in CRS patients compared to controls, with a prevalence ranging from 32% to 91% of cases. No author considered nonacid reflux events. There was significant heterogeneity in the inclusion criteria; definition of reflux and association outcomes, limiting the ability to draw clear conclusions. Pepsin was found in sinonasal secretions more frequently in CRS patients than controls. CONCLUSION: Laryngopharyngeal reflux and GERD may be contributing factors of CRS therapeutic resistance, but future studies are needed to confirm the association considering nonacid reflux events.",

Proximal gastrectomy with direct esophagogastrostomy (EG), double-tract reconstruction (DTR), and double flap-technique (DFT) are considered function-preserving surgeries for proximal early GC rather than total gastrectomy (TG). We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing EG, DTR, DFT, and TG to determine the surgical strategy for proximal GC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for studies that compared at least two of the following: EG, DTR, DFT, and TG. Then, we conducted a frequentist network meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical outcomes of 4 surgical methods. RESULTS: We included 38 studies and 3,497 patients. In this study, 15.4% of patients underwent EG, 39.2% DTR, 10.9% DFT, and 34.5% TG. Reflux esophagitis was statistically higher in EG than it was in DFT and DTR. Anastomotic stenosis was significantly lower in DTR than it was in EG. The 12-month postoperative hemoglobin level was the highest in DFT. DTR showed a significantly higher level than EG and TG. TG had the significantly lowest postoperative 12-month total protein level. For operative time, DFT showed the longest duration, and DTR showed a significantly longer duration than EG. For the first flatus time, DFT was the fastest, and DTR was significantly faster than TG. Regarding hospital length of stay, DFT was statistically shorter than the others. CONCLUSIONS: DTR and DFT are more favorable methods than EG and TG, each with distinct advantages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42024598575.",

Despite its high incidence, no cure has been identified for RIE, and validated treatment methods remain elusive. This systematic review explores global clinical research on herbal medicines for RIE treatment, assessing their efficacy in prevention and treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search across 5 databases targeted randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs published before June 2024 were eligible if they investigated herbal medicine use for RIE prevention or treatment. Using Cochrane methodology and RevMan 5.4 software, a meta-analysis was conducted, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated with the GRADE system. RESULTS: Following the literature selection process, 81 RCTs with 7283 patients were included in the analysis. All studies administered herbal medicine to the treatment group and usual care with conventional medicine to the control group. Meta-analysis revealed that, in terms of overall incidence rate, herbal medicine demonstrated a significantly greater preventive effect compared to usual care (relative risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). Similarly, herbal medicine showed superior efficacy in improving RIE treatment outcomes compared to usual care (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.21-1.38). Herbal medicine exhibited a comparable safety profile with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and no significant liver toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal medicine demonstrated significant benefits in reducing RIE incidence, delaying onset, alleviating symptoms, and shortening duration in patients undergoing radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies. However, due to limited certainty of the evidence, well-designed, large-scale RCTs are essential to establish the clinical effectiveness of herbal medicine for prevention and treatment, ensuring high-quality evidence for incidence rate and treatment effective rates.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of VPZ versus LPZ in the healing and maintenance phases of EE. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published till 12 December 2024 that evaluated efficacy and safety of VPZ and LPZ in patients with EE. Outcomes included endoscopic healing rates, recurrence rates, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMA) were performed using Review Manager 5.4.1 and Bayesian models. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 7 RCTs with 4,903 patients. In the healing phase, VPZ showed significantly higher endoscopic healing rates than LPZ at Week 2 (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; p < 0.0001, I CONCLUSIONS: VPZ demonstrates greater efficacy in healing and maintaining remission in EE, particularly in severe cases, with a safety profile comparable to LPZ. These findings support VPZ as an effective alternative to PPIs. However, long-term studies are warranted.",

The optimal treatment strategy for this condition remains uncertain. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence for the treatment of lymphocytic esophagitis. METHODS: We performed a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines, searching MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar. Studies with non-primary data or insufficient treatment data were excluded. Descriptive statistics were performed on patient demographics and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty nine articles from 2012-2024 were included (154 patients total). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were the most common initial therapy for LyE (n = 65), followed by topical steroids (n = 23). A greater proportion of patients experienced a symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic response from the initial use of topical steroids as monotherapy or part of combination therapy (with PPIs) compared to PPIs alone. Symptomatic recurrence was more common after initial use of topical steroids compared to PPIs. Balloon dilation was effective in relieving symptomatic esophageal dysphagia. Other therapies included biologics, endoscopic botulinum injections, sucralfate, and tacrolimus. The average follow-up duration was 8.98 months. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LyE, topical steroids seem to provide greater symptomatic and histologic benefit compared to PPIs, although recurrence is more common. For patients not already on acid suppression therapy, PPIs may still be a reasonable first-line option, especially when prioritizing safety. Further prospective studies are needed to formally assess the comparative safety and efficacy of the various treatment modalities, including novel immunosuppressive therapies.",

Despite comprehensive safety measures, healthy tissue is also irradiated, causing side effects like oral mucositis and dermatitis. Antioxidants, which are known for scavenging free radicals, may reduce these adverse effects, but their impact on radiotherapy efficacy remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the influence of antioxidant supplementation on radiation-induced side effects, tumor outcome and quality of life. In April 2024, a systematic research was conducted searching five databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO) to find studies looking at the effect of antioxidant supplementation during radiotherapy on radiation-induced side effects and parameters of tumor outcome or survival. Antioxidants can mitigate radiation-induced side effects, with vitamins C and E showing positive effects on oral mucositis, xerostomia and cardiac function. Curcumin and EGCG improved symptoms such as mucositis, dermatitis and esophagitis, while glutathione-enhanced treatment compliance but did not provide significant protection against side effects. However, multiple studies indicate that the concurrent use of antioxidants during cancer treatment may impair tumor control, increase recurrence rates and reduce survival outcomes. Antioxidants may reduce radiation-induced side effects but could compromise treatment efficacy. Due to inconsistent evidence and potential risks, clinical recommendations are premature.

While various treatment modalities exist for management of post-SG BE, conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) can be an effective option which can also improve gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the effectiveness of RYGB for resolving BE has not been rigorously studied. This systematic review evaluates the outcomes of BE in patients converted from SG to RYGB. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Studies reporting BE onset following SG and subsequent RYGB conversion were included. Data extracted included patient demographics, Prague classification, dysplasia status, time from SG to BE diagnosis and time to RYGB conversion, and resolution of BE post-RYGB. The validated MINORS tool was used to assess the quality and risk of bias of reviewed studies. RESULTS: A total of 4 studies were included, comprising 21 patients who underwent conversion from SG to RYGB with BE. The weighted mean age at RYGB was 46.7 ± 13.8 years, with an initial BMI of 44.7 ± 2.7 kg/m CONCLUSION: Based on these results, SG to RYGB conversion appears to be an effective intervention for BE, with the majority of patients achieving histological regression and resolution of symptoms.

Asthma has traditionally been the most common underlying cause. However, recently, other conditions have emerged. Therefore, our goal was to systematically analyze and compare the changes in the underlying causes of RP. METHODS: We searched four databases from their inception until November 2024 for studies in children under 18 years with RP, where the underlying causes were described. To compare changes in the prevalence of underlying causes, we divide them into periods I (1999-2013) and II (2014-2024). RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (n = 3440 children with RP) met the final criteria for analysis. In 94% of the patients, an underlying cause was identified. Among the 39 underlying conditions described, the top ten were asthma (15.9%), aspiration (14.1%), congenital heart diseases [CHD] (13.2%), lung/airway congenital malformations (10.7%), immunodeficiency (10.4%), bronchial hyperresponsiveness [BHR] (8.0%), neurological causes (8.02%), atopy (7.3%), gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD] (4.5%), and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections [URTIs] (3.7%). Notably, compared to Period I, a significant decrease was observed in asthma, aspiration, BHR, chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent URTIs, middle lobe syndrome, CF, infections, obesity, foreign body aspiration, and pulmonary hemosiderosis/hemorrhage in Period II. In contrast, during Period II, a significant increase in lung/airway congenital malformations, immunodeficiency, CHD, atopy, neurological causes, PCD, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, hematologic diseases, and oromotor incoordination was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In the last decade, the underlying causes of RP have changed, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive and tailored diagnostic approach.",

Intragastric pH > 4 holding time ratios were significantly higher in the LAF & ESO Group compared to the ESO Group, both overall (85.4% vs. 77.7%, P = 0.003) and specifically during nighttime (92.6% vs. 77.2%, P = 0.006). Furthermore, the incidence of nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB) was markedly reduced in the LAF & ESO Group (29.2% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.001). Esophageal acid exposure times, however, were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). Although both groups experienced symptom improvement, patients in the LAF & ESO Group demonstrated superior enhancement in sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Notably, patients without NAB exhibited a more substantial improvement in sleep quality from baseline after treatment. Therefore, adding bedtime lafutidine to esomeprazole effectively inhibits nocturnal gastric acid secretion and reduces the incidence of NAB. GERD patients who received lafutidine in addition to esomeprazole achieved a more significant improvement in sleep quality correlated with NAB reduction.",

Conventional diagnostic approaches, including symptom-based questionnaires, empirical acid suppression trials, and single-modality objective tests, demonstrate limited sensitivity and specificity, often resulting in diagnostic inaccuracies and inefficient resource utilization. To overcome these diagnostic challenges, this article provides a systematic review of recent advancements and ongoing debates in GERD diagnostics, with a focus on the diagnostic value of multimodal parameters as outlined in the Lyon Consensus 2.0. It also explores the clinical relevance of emerging auxiliary diagnostic metrics. We emphasize that integrating clinical symptomatology, endoscopic findings, esophageal physiological measurements, and psychosocial factors (augmented by composite scoring systems and artificial intelligence), offers a promising strategy for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment of GERD. 胃食管反流病（GERD）临床表现异质性高，而传统诊断方法（如症状问卷、经验性抑酸试验、单项客观检查）敏感性和特异性不足，导致误诊、漏诊及医疗资源浪费。为突破这一诊断困境，本文旨在系统梳理近年GERD诊断领域的核心进展与争议，重点探讨以里昂共识2.0为基础、整合多模态客观参数对GERD的诊断价值，并分析新型辅助诊断参数的临床意义。本文强调，融合症状学、内镜、食管功能学及精神心理评估等多模态数据，应用复合评分或人工智能模型进行综合分析，是实现GERD精准诊断和个体化管理的关键方向。.",

However, device-associated adverse events and unpleasant experiences, reported by patients during pH monitoring have led to the invention of more convenient pH monitors such as Bravo wireless capsule. To compare the interference with daily activities and major adverse events during pH monitoring with Bravo wireless capsule (Bravo) versus conventional intranasal catheter (catheter), PubMed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, and Google Scholar were searched up to March 20, 2015. Only randomized controlled trials in adult patients that compared the interference with routine daily activities and adverse events between Bravo and catheter pH monitors were included. After screening 574 articles, three unique studies with 167 patients met our inclusion criteria. The average age of patients enrolled in these studies was 51 years. Interference with normal daily activities was more in the catheter than Bravo group: 75 ± 5 versus 92 ± 2, P < 0.001 (Andrews et al, findings were reported as100 mm, mean visual analogue scale (VAS) ± standard error of the mean, 100 = completely normal); Wong et al.

Overall adverse events were more in the catheter group than Bravo (39 ± 4 vs. 26 ± 4, P = 0.012 for Andrews et al. (100 been the worst) and 5.1 (2.0-6.6) vs. 2.1 (0.5-4.6), P < 0.001 for Wenner et al.). No overall adverse events recorded for Wong et al. Most patients in catheter group complained of nasal and throat symptoms. Significantly, runny nose in 24 out of 25 patients (96%) catheter versus 13 out of 25 (52%) Bravo, P = 0.001 and nose pain 15 out 25 (60%) versus 8 out of 25 patients (32%), P = 0.047, respectively for Wong et al.

Reported prevalence varies widely, with differences observed across pregnancy trimesters. This first systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizing global data aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and risk of GERD symptoms during pregnancy, including trimester-specific trends. METHODOLOGY: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 1 January 1975 to 10 July 2025. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251102794). Eligible studies included observational studies reporting the prevalence of GERD symptoms in pregnant populations. Two independent reviewers screened articles, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis model was applied. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies involving 9497 pregnant participants were included. The pooled prevalence of GERD symptoms during pregnancy was 40.96% (95% CI: 27.63-54.28). Subgroup analysis by trimester revealed a progressive increase in GERD prevalence, from 26.12% in the first trimester to 33.40% in the second, peaking at 55.93% in the third, reflecting the growing physiological burden. In studies that included non-pregnant control groups, pregnant women had a significantly higher risk of experiencing GERD symptoms compared to non-pregnant controls (OR = 8.37; 95% CI: 2.93-23.89). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of heartburn was 43.81% (95% CI: 23.74-63.87), while regurgitation affected 37.94% (95% CI: 26.23-49.65) of pregnant women. CONCLUSION: GERD symptoms are highly prevalent during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. Early identification and management may improve maternal comfort and quality of life.",

We aim to assess the rate and outcome of LD in children and perform a systematic review. METHOD: We reviewed all children (<18 years) who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with duodenal biopsy between January 2000 and June 2019 to identify LD cases and control group. Demographics, clinical, and pathologic information were reviewed and recorded. A systematic review including our findings was performed. RESULTS: During the study period 12,744 children underwent an EGD with biopsies. Of those, we identified 426 children with LD (3%) and 474 controls. The median age in years was 10.7 and 12.6 and there were 254 (60%) and 278 (59%) girls in the LD and control group, respectively. The most common presenting symptoms in both groups were abdominal pain (52%), gastroesophageal acid reflux disease (18%), diarrhea (16%), and vomiting (12%). Diarrhea (21% vs 12%, P < 0.001) and constipation (2% vs 0.4%, P = 0.021) were statistically different between the LD and control group, respectively. Median follow-up (range) is 3.6 (0.0, 190.9) and 3.1 (0.0, 194.2) in the LD and control group, respectively. CD (5% vs 0%, P < 0.001), Crohn disease (9% vs 3%, P = 0.003) and Helicobacter pylori gastritis (3% vs 1%, P = 0.021) were more common in the LD group. CONCLUSIONS: The Rate of LD in children is similar to reported rate in adults. In the absence of Crohn disease, CD or H. Pylori, LD seems to be a benign and transient histologic finding in children.",

We conducted a post hoc evaluation of interobserver agreement between CT endoscopists and independent expert adjudicators in a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of a new acid suppression therapy. Trial endoscopists captured endoscopic images/videos and documented esophagitis severity using the LA classification. Adjudicators reviewed images/videos on a web-based platform. If the first two adjudicators disagreed and the third adjudicator did not produce a majority verdict, all three conferred to reach consensus. Cohen's kappa (κ) evaluated interobserver agreement. Cohen's weighted kappa (κw) evaluated agreement corrected for disagreement extent. Of 388 images/videos with adequate quality, trial endoscopists and adjudicators agreed on esophagitis severity in 168 (43.3%) cases, and assigned more severe grades than adjudicators for 185 (47.7%) cases. Agreement was fair between trial endoscopists and adjudicators (κ: 0.27; κw: 0.40), moderate between individual adjudicators (κ: 0.43 to 0.47), and good between adjudicators and final diagnosis (κ: 0.75 to 0.78). After adjusting for disagreement extent, agreement was good between individual adjudicators (κw: 0.63 to 0.66), and very good between adjudicators and final diagnosis (κw: 0.84 to 0.87). Interobserver agreement on esophagitis severity between CT endoscopists and adjudicators was fair. Initial agreement between adjudicators was moderate, but agreement between adjudicators and consensus diagnosis was very good.

METHODS: We searched 5 databases for adults who underwent SG or RYGB and had esophageal pH test and/or esophageal manometry before and after surgery. A separate systemic search of observational studies and a retrospective review at 3 institutions of adults who developed EAC after these surgeries were conducted. Outcomes were changes in manometric and pH parameters and EAC cases after SG and RYGB. RESULTS: A total of 27 nonrandomized studies (SG: 612 patients; RYGB: 470 patients) were included. After SG, lower esophageal sphincter pressure and esophageal body amplitude were decreased and the risk of ineffective esophageal motility was increased. Total and recumbent acid exposure times were increased. After RYGB, an increased risk of ineffective esophageal motility was observed. Total, upright, and recumbent acid exposure times were decreased. The total reflux episodes remained unchanged but with increased nonacid reflux and decreased acid reflux events. Including our largest series, 31 EAC cases have been reported to date after SG and RYGB. DISCUSSION: This systematic review demonstrates increased acid reflux after SG and decreased acid reflux after RYGB. An observed increased nonacid reflux after RYGB might contribute to failure of gastroesophageal reflux disease improvement. This refluxate might be noxious to the esophagus, warranting further studies. RYGB might not entirely preserve esophageal function as previously believed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the earliest clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Proton pump inhibitors are ineffective in controlling symptoms in up to 40 % of cases, and their chronic use (often) at high-doses and long-term safety are a concern. For this reason, surgery has been proposed as an alternative management strategy for refractory GERD in SSc patients. However, consensus on the optimal surgical procedure, timing, and ideal patient population, is still lacking. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the safety, efficacy, indications, timing and feasibility of different surgical approaches to fundoplication (FP) for treating SSc-related refractory GERD. METHODS: Four research questions based on the PICO framework were developed to guide the systematic literature review (SLR) which was completed 01 September 2024. The search was performed across different databases including PubMed, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Emcare and Academic Search Premier. References were independently screened by two reviewers who also independently assessed the full text of eligible articles and extracted data. Due to the heterogeneity of retrieved studies, narrative summaries were used to present the data. RESULTS: Of the 986 retrieved papers, 23 were eligible for inclusion. In these studies, 184 SSc patients had an anti-reflux surgical procedure and were included in the analysis. Most of the studies were conducted in surgical settings and relevant rheumatological data were largely missing. Refractory GERD symptoms were the most common indication for surgery, with post-operative dysphagia being the most frequent complication. In 14 studies, FP was effective in reducing the GERD symptoms, 1 study had indeterminate findings while in 4 studies, unfavourable results for FP were reported. All the included studies reported a low mortality and morbidity rate related to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the surgical management of refractory GERD remains a challenge due to the limited evidence, which is largely of poor quality. However, the safety and beneficial effect of FP obtained in the majority of SSc patients, suggests that it may be a beneficial intervention in some patients. The definition of minimal requirements to perform surgical studies on refractory GERD, identifying a specific SSc subset of patients that would most likely benefit from FP, and determining the optimal timing for surgery are warranted.",

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), initially developed for diabetes, have shown neuroprotective properties. AIM: To assess the disease-modifying potential and safety of GLP-1 RAs in PD. METHODS: We followed Cochrane Handbook. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating GLP-1 RAs in PD that were identified through comprehensive database searches through March 2025. Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the RCTs' quality. A random-effects model was used to calculate mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their confidence intervals (CIs) and analyze them using R. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of four placebo-controlled RCTs found that GLP-1 RAs demonstrated a statistically significant overall improvement in ON-medication motor scores (MDS-UPDRS Part III: MD -0.75, 95% CI [-1.50, -0.0009]; P = 0.04). However, this benefit was not consistently observed at individual follow-up time points. In contrast, the pooled analysis for OFF-medication motor scores showed no significant overall improvement (MD -1.39; P = 0.16), despite considerable heterogeneity; only the 60-week follow-up showed a significant benefit (MD -3.0; P = 0.005). No significant differences were found for health-related quality of life (PDQ-39), other MDS-UPDRS domains (Part I, Part II, or Part IV), or Levodopa equivalent daily dose. GLP-1 RAs were associated with significantly higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux) and weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not sufficiently support the routine use of GLP-1 RAs for motor improvement in PD.",

This paper aimed to assess the incidence of reflux disease following these bariatric procedures. A literature search was conducted to identify observational studies and clinical trials reporting patients developed GERD disease after LSG. Twenty-two studies included in the analysis, involve 20,495 participants, indicated that the estimated proportion of patients who developed post-surgery GERD was 0.35 (95% CI 0.30-0.41). Subgroup analysis revealed a proportion of 0.33 (95% CI 0.27-0.38) in observational studies and 0.58 (95% CI 0.39-0.75) in clinical trials. High heterogeneity was noted across studies (I",
