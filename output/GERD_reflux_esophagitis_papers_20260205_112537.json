      "abstract": "In Japan, with the increasing prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and growing public interest, the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology issued Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for GERD (1st edition) in 2009 and a revised 2nd edition in 2015. A number of studies on GERD were subsequently conducted in Japan and abroad, and vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), became available for the first time in Japan in February 2015. The revised 3rd edition (Japanese edition), which incorporates new findings and information, was published in April 2021. These guidelines are summarized herein, particularly sections related to the treatment of GERD. The important clinical issues addressed in the present revision are (i) the introduction of treatment algorithms that classify GERD into reflux esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease, (ii) the clarification of treatment algorithms based on to the severity of reflux esophagitis, and (iii) the positioning of vonoprazan in the treatment for GERD. The present guidelines propose vonoprazan as the initial/maintenance treatment for severe reflux esophagitis. They also recommend vonoprazan or PPI as an initial treatment for mild reflux esophagitis and recommended PPI and proposed vonoprazan as maintenance treatment. These updated guidelines offer the best clinical strategies for GERD patients in Japan and hope that they will be of global use for the diagnosis and treatment for GERD.",

      "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux is a common physiologic event in infants in which gastric contents pass from the stomach into the esophagus. Gastroesophageal reflux may be asymptomatic or cause regurgitation or \"spit up.\" This occurs daily in approximately 40% of infants. Symptoms often begin before 8 weeks of life, peak at approximately 4 months of age, and usually resolve by 1 year. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux is 2% to 8% in children and adolescents. Family physicians should reassure parents that gastroesophageal reflux is self-limited, not pathologic, and does not warrant routine testing or pharmacologic treatment. Gastroesophageal reflux may progress to gastroesophageal reflux disease when the reflux leads to troublesome symptoms (eg, recurrent postprandial expressions of distress or pain, coughing, choking) or causes complications, such as esophageal stricture or reflux esophagitis. Diagnostic tests, such as endoscopy, barium study, multichannel intraluminal impedance, and pH monitoring, may be used when there is diagnostic uncertainty or alarm symptoms are present (eg, bilious or projectile vomiting, hematemesis). Conservative treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants include the use of thickening agents or extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas in formula-fed infants or maternal elimination of dairy for infants who are fed breast milk. Infants and children who do not improve with conservative measures may require pharmacologic treatment, including an empiric trial of acid-suppression therapy for 4 to 8 weeks.",

      "abstract": "Esophagitis in cats and dogs is a consequence of increased exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastroduodenal reflux. Causes can include anesthesia-related reflux, frequent vomiting, or lodged foreign bodies. An exception is eosinophilic esophagitis, an emerging primary inflammatory disease of the esophagus with a presumed allergic etiology. Reflux esophagitis owing to lower esophageal sphincter incompetence is often suspected; a tentative diagnosis can be made by endoscopic assessment, wireless esophageal pH-monitoring, or histologic examination. Because it can be difficult to distinguish diet-responsive upper gastrointestinal disease from esophagitis, response to treatment with gastric acid suppressants is needed to confirm the tentative diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "We performed this review to clarify which dietary and lifestyle factors are related to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Through a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese BioMedical Literature (CBM) databases, we identified articles with clear definitions of GERD, including nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD), reflux esophagitis (RE) and Barrett's esophagus (BE), that included dietary and lifestyle factors as independent factors affecting the onset of GERD (expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). Due to heterogeneity among the studies, we used descriptive statistical analyses to analyze and synthesize each outcome based on the disease type. In total, 72 articles were included, conducted in ten Western countries (26 articles in total) and nine Eastern countries (46 articles in total). We categorized dietary factors into 20 items and lifestyle factors into 11 items. GERD is related to many irregular dietary and lifestyle habits (such as a habit of midnight snacking: OR=5.08, 95% CI 4.03-6.4; skipping breakfast: OR=2.7, 95% CI 2.17-3.35; eating quickly: OR=4.06, 95% CI 3.11-5.29; eating very hot foods: OR=1.81, 95% CI 1.37-2.4; and eating beyond fullness: OR=2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.73). Vegetarian diets (consumption of nonvegetarian food (no/yes); OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.211-0.545) and no intake of meat (OR=0.841, 95% CI 0.715-0.990) were negatively related to GERD, while meat (daily meat, fish, and egg intake: OR=1.088, 95% CI 1.042-1.135) and fat (high-fat diet: OR=7.568, 95% CI 4.557-8.908) consumption were positively related to GERD. An interval of less than three hours between dinner and bedtime (OR=7.45, 95% CI 3.38-16.4) was positively related to GERD, and proper physical exercise (physical exercise >30 minutes (>3 times/week): OR=0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) was negatively correlated with GERD. Smoking (OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.264), alcohol consumption (OR=1.278, 95% CI 1.207-1.353) and mental state (poor mental state: OR=1.278, 95% CI 1.207-1.353) were positively correlated with GERD. RE (vitamin C: OR=0.46, 95% CI=0.24-0.90) and BE (vitamin C: OR=0.44,95% CI 0.2-0.98; vitamin E: OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.83) were generally negatively correlated with antioxidant intake. In conclusion, many dietary and lifestyle factors affect the onset of GERD, and these factors differ among regions and disease types. These findings need to be further confirmed in subsequent studies.",

The diagnosis of GERD primarily emphasizes symptom-based approaches that focus on heartburn and acid regurgitation. GERD can be confirmed through proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, endoscopy, and 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring. Of these methods, endoscopy plays a critical role in diagnosing reflux esophagitis. Recently, both PPIs and potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) have been recommended as first-line treatments, with P-CABs showing greater efficacy in severe cases or in patients unresponsive to PPIs.

      "abstract": "Esophagitis is the end result of a variety of insults to epithelial homeostasis. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a manifestation of non-IgE-mediated food allergy that most commonly affects the esophagus of males who have other atopic phenomena. Reflux esophagitis reflects repeated exposure to acidic gastric contents because of failure of the normal protections afforded by the LES. Because certain histologic features can be present in either condition, endoscopic biopsy alone does not distinguish them. Their symptoms overlap, but the treatment options are very different, such that making a formal diagnosis by following consensus guidelines is essential. A treatment protocol designed to manage the inflammation by controlling the provocative factors (acid for GERD and food antigens for EoE) or suppressing the inflammation (ie, topical steroids for EoE) should result in normalization of the mucosa and resolution of symptoms. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic condition that rarely remits spontaneously, so any therapeutic modality will need to be continued indefinitely.",

      "abstract": "Recently, multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring was added to the repertoire of tests to evaluate the (patho)physiology of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in children. Its advantage above the sole monitoring of the esophageal pH lies in the ability of the detection of both acid and nonacid GER and to discern between liquid and gas GER. Currently, combined 24 h pH-MII monitoring is recommended for evaluation of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its relation to symptoms in infants and children, despite the lack of reference values in these age groups. There is new evidence in the current issue of this Journal supporting the role of pH-MII monitoring for the evaluation of children presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of GERD and the prediction of the presence of reflux esophagitis. However, several issues should be taken into account when performing pH-MII clinically.",

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease has been explained by acid-peptic model. However, related with the progress of the diagnostic modalities, another phenotypical group of patients were defined and called \"functional disorders of the esophagus\". These patients are important because diagnosis is particularly difficult, co-morbid disorders especially psychiatric diseases are common, proton pump inhibitor response is low, and surgical results are very poor. Simpler and translational science studies are required in functional groups in order to differentiate from acid-peptic disorders. New and more accurate diagnostic modalities as well as therapeutic approaches are strongly needed in this particularly new and exciting era, especially in the effect of neuromodulators. Current diagnostic modalities should also be evaluated and in fact, normal values should be established. New medications, especially acting at the level of esophageal epithelium and intercellular spaces, might shift the paradigm.",
