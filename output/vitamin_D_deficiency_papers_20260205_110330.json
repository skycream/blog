The consequences of vitamin D deficiency cannot be under estimated. There has been an association of vitamin D deficiency with a myriad of acute and chronic illnesses including preeclampsia, childhood dental caries, periodontitis, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease, deadly cancers, type 2 diabetes and neurological disorders. This review is to put into perspective the controversy surrounding the definition for vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency as well as providing guidance for how to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.",

Extensive research efforts have shown that vitamin D deficiency may be related to the development of autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been shown to be inversely related to disease activity. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Vitamin D deficiency has also been observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has been found to be inversely related to disease activity and renal involvement. In addition, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms have been studied in SLE. Vitamin D levels have been studied in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, and vitamin D deficiency may be related to neuropathy and the development of lymphoma in the context of Sjogren's syndrome. Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Vitamin D deficiency has also been observed in systemic sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency may be implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, and it may be administered to prevent autoimmune disease and reduce pain in the context of autoimmune rheumatic disorders.",

Phase 3 randomized clinical trials to investigate the influence of long-term vitamin D replacement on growth, body composition, and pubertal development of school-aged children with vitamin D deficiency are lacking. To determine whether weekly oral vitamin D supplementation influences linear growth, body composition, or pubertal development in school-aged children living in a setting where vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. This secondary analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from June 2016 to June 2019 at 18 grade schools in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. School-aged children (6 to 13 years at baseline) attending participating schools were included. Exclusion criteria included a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube assay result, conditions or medications associated with altered vitamin D metabolism, use of vitamin D supplements, signs of rickets, or intention to move from Ulaanbaatar within 4 years. Of 11 475 children invited to participate in the study, 9814 underwent QFT testing, and 8851 with negative results were included in the study. All but 1 participant in the placebo group completed follow-up and were included in the present analysis. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to February 2022. Weekly oral doses of vitamin D3, 14 000 IU, (n = 4418), or placebo (n = 4433) for 3 years. Mean z scores for height for age, body mass index for age, and waist-to-height ratio; mean percentage body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass; and mean Tanner scores for pubertal development. Of 8851 participants, 4366 (49.3%) were female, and 8165 (92.2%) were of Khalkh ethnicity; the mean (SD) age was 9.4 (1.6) years. A total of 8453 participants (95.5%) were vitamin D deficient at baseline, and mean end-of-study 25(OH)D concentrations among participants randomized to vitamin D vs placebo were 31.0 vs 10.7 ng/mL (mean difference, 20.3; 95% CI; 19.9-20.6). However, vitamin D supplementation did not influence mean height for age, body mass index for age, waist-to-height ratio, percentage body fat, fat mass, fat-free mass, or Tanner scores, either overall or within subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration less than 10 ng/mL vs 10 ng/mL or greater, estimated calcium intake less than 500 mg/d vs 500 mg/d or greater, or male vs female sex. In school-aged children in this study with low baseline vitamin D status, oral vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 14 000 IU per week for 3 years was effective in elevating 25(OH)D concentrations but did not influence growth, body composition, or pubertal development.

Numerous studies have assessed that vitamin D deficiency is highly related to dental caries in primary and permanent teeth in children. The aim of this study is to elaborate a narrative review about proposed mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency interacts with dental caries process in children. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may cause intrauterine enamel defects, and through childhood is accompanied by insufficient activity of antibacterial peptides, decreased saliva secretion, and a low level of calcium in saliva.  Conclusion: In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency would increase the risk of caries in the primary and/or permanent dentition. Relationship between vitamin D deficiency and dental caries is evident enough for vitamin D deficiency to be considered as a risk factor for dental caries in children. Optimal levels of vitamin D throughout pregnancy and childhood may be considered an additional preventive measure for dental caries in the primary and permanent dentition.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, contributing to nutritional rickets and osteomalacia which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children and adolescents. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation given to infants, or lactating mothers, on vitamin D deficiency, bone density and growth in healthy term breastfed infants. We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to 29 May 2020 supplemented by searches of clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in breastfeeding mother-infant pairs comparing vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers compared to placebo or no intervention, or sunlight, or that compare vitamin D supplementation of infants to supplementation of mothers. Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. We included 19 studies with 2837 mother-infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to lactating mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus lactating mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. Vitamin D supplementation given to infants: vitamin D at 400 IU/day may increase 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 22.63 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.05 to 28.21; participants = 334; studies = 6; low-certainty) and may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; participants = 274; studies = 4; low-certainty). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine if vitamin D given to the infant reduces the risk of vitamin D deficiency (25-OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) up till six months of age (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.05; participants = 122; studies = 2), affects bone mineral content (BMC), or the incidence of biochemical or radiological rickets (all very-low certainty). We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. There were no studies of higher doses of infant vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) compared to placebo. Vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers: vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers may increase infant 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 24.60 nmol/L, 95% CI 21.59 to 27.60; participants = 597; studies = 7; low-certainty), may reduce the incidences of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; participants = 512; studies = 5; low-certainty), vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24; participants = 512; studies = 5; low-certainty) and biochemical rickets (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.44; participants = 229; studies = 2; low-certainty). The two studies that reported biochemical rickets used maternal dosages of oral D3 60,000 IU/day for 10 days and oral D3 60,000 IU postpartum and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. However, infant BMC was not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on radiological rickets (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.31; participants = 536; studies = 3; very low-certainty). All studies of maternal supplementation enrolled populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. We are uncertain of the effects of maternal supplementation on infant growth and adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D supplementation given to infants compared with supplementation given to lactating mothers: infant vitamin D supplementation compared to lactating mother supplementation may increase infant 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 14.35 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.64 to 19.06; participants = 269; studies = 4; low-certainty). Infant vitamin D supplementation may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94; participants = 334; studies = 4) and may reduce vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; participants = 334; studies = 4) but the evidence is very uncertain. Infant BMC and radiological rickets were not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on infant biochemical rickets. All studies enrolled patient populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Studies compared an infant dose of vitamin D 400 IU/day with varying maternal vitamin D doses from 400 IU/day to > 4000 IU/day. We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. For breastfed infants, vitamin D supplementation 400 IU/day for up to six months increases 25-OH vitamin D levels and reduces vitamin D insufficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to assess its effect on vitamin D deficiency and bone health. For higher-risk infants who are breastfeeding, maternal vitamin D supplementation reduces vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants led to greater increases in infant 25-OH vitamin D levels, reductions in vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency compared to supplementation of lactating mothers. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. Maternal higher dose supplementation (≥ 4000 IU/day) produced similar infant 25-OH vitamin D levels as infant supplementation of 400 IU/day. The certainty of evidence was graded as low to very low for all outcomes.",
