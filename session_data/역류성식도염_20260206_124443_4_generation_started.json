      "abstract": "Development of these guidelines is mandated by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Recommendations are based on diligent review of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors. There are 9 broad clinical questions with 123 recommendation numbers that include 160 specific statements (85 [53.1%] strong [Grade A]; 48 [30.0%] intermediate [Grade B], and 11 [6.9%] weak [Grade C], with 16 [10.0%] based on expert opinion [Grade D]) that build a comprehensive medical care plan for obesity. There were 133 (83.1%) statements based on strong (best evidence level [BEL] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or intermediate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) levels of scientific substantiation. There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based recommendation grades (Grades A-C = 144) that were adjusted based on subjective factors. Among the 1,790 reference citations used in this CPG, 524 (29.3%) were based on strong (evidence level [EL] 1), 605 (33.8%) were based on intermediate (EL 2), and 308 (17.2%) were based on weak (EL 3) scientific studies, with 353 (19.7%) based on reviews and opinions (EL 4). The final recommendations recognize that obesity is a complex, adiposity-based chronic disease, where management targets both weight-related complications and adiposity to improve overall health and quality of life. The detailed evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses real-world medical care of patients with obesity, including screening, diagnosis, evaluation, selection of therapy, treatment goals, and individualization of care. The goal is to facilitate high-quality care of patients with obesity and provide a rational, scientific approach to management that optimizes health outcomes and safety.

This pattern was consistent across age bands and gender, with the highest retention observed in subscribers aged 30-49 years and subscribers who were male. Industry-specific analysis showed that subscribers with obesity in manufacturing, financial/insurance/real estate, and service/public administration had the highest retention, whereas the lowest retention was observed in retail. Subscribers with obesity-related comorbidities had a retention rate up to 10 percentage points higher at year 5 and 5 percentage points higher at year 10 compared with the overall obesity diagnosis cohort.

      "abstract": "With respective prevalence of 13% and 9.6%, obesity and chronic cough are two common conditions worldwide. The crucial role of obesity has been highlighted in the development and progression of many respiratory diseases. According to the results of epidemiological studies, obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, may also be associated with chronic cough (CC). CC seems to be more severe in obese patients compared to normal-weight subjects. The management of CC may differ slightly in obese patients compared to non-obese patients. Indeed, asthma and reflux diseases, which are considered key factors in the onset of CC, are characterised by more severe symptoms in obese patients. Asthma is associated with a resistance to usual treatments in obese patients but no data are available on the effect of inhaled therapies in obese subjects with cough variant asthma. Other emergent causes of CC have been reported in obese patients. Obstructive sleep apnoea and diabetes may also be involved in the development of CC and should be taken into account in obese patients with CC. The beneficial effect of weight loss on chronic cough has been suggested.",

      "results": "The study included 2,913 pilgrims, with an average age of 53.9 ± 11.8 years. Table 1 outlines the demographic characteristics of Hajj pilgrims included in the study. Among these participants, 1,176 (40.4%) reported cough symptoms. The majority of participants were in the age groups of 50–64 years (57.3%) and 30–49 years (32.8%). Within these age groups, the prevalence of cough symptoms was 60.7% and 27.9%, respectively. The male-to-female ratio among participants with cough symptoms was approximately 1:1, consistent with the overall study population. Regarding educational background, a significant portion of participants did not disclose their educational attainment, with 55.3% overall, and 33.7% of those with cough symptoms, not providing this information. Among those with cough symptoms, 18.9% had obtained university degrees and completed intermediate or secondary education. In contrast, the percentages for the entire participant group were 13.9% and 12.7%, respectively. The prevalence of illiterate participants was relatively low, recorded at 6.79% among all participants and 10.21% among those with cough symptoms.Table 1Demographic characteristics of Hajj pilgrims participating in the study.Table 1CharacteristicReported cough symptomTotalN%N%Total117640.4 %2913100%Age group≤29100.90471.6330-4932827.995632.850-6455560.7125757.3≥6528310.56538.27SexFemale57448.8140048.1Male60251.2151351.9Education levelIntermediate or Secondary22218.937112.7University22218.940413.9Read & write21618.2932911.31Illiterate12010.211986.79preferred not to say39633.7161155.3Nationality by World Health Organization RegionAfrican Region30626.080327.6South-East Asia Region18215.4770824.3European Region1048.8431110.87Eastern Mediterranean Region49041.795632.8Western Pacific Region947.991354.63Chronic disease62653.399033.9\n\nDemographic characteristics of Hajj pilgrims participating in the study.\n\nGeographically, the Eastern Mediterranean Region had the highest participation, comprising 32.8% of the total participants and 41.7% of those reporting cough symptoms.

Among all participants, 33.9% reported having a chronic disease, while 66.1% did not. The prevalence of chronic diseases was higher among those experiencing cough symptoms, at 53.3%, compared to those without chronic conditions but who had a cough.\n\nFigure 1 presents an overview of chronic diseases among Hajj pilgrims, highlighting the differences between those with and without cough. Notably, diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent condition, with 357 pilgrims reporting coughs compared to 207 without cough. Similarly, hypertension was common, with 330 pilgrims experiencing cough, while 220 did not.Figure 1The number of Hajj pilgrims with chronic diseases based on the have or absence of cough.Figure 1\n\nThe number of Hajj pilgrims with chronic diseases based on the have or absence of cough.\n\nTable 2 illustrates the distribution of associated symptoms among 1,176 participants with cough.

      "abstract": "To preserve the aesthetic benefits achieved with Bikini line sleeve gastrectomy (BLSG), we have devised a novel approach for simultaneous hiatal hernia repair (HHR), known as bikini-line hiatal hernia repair (BLHHR). This manuscript presents our initial experience with BLHHR and assesses its feasibility and outcomes. A prospective preliminary study was conducted on patients who underwent BLHHR between September 2020 and October 2022. Patient demographics, preoperative assessments, operative details, postoperative outcomes, and aesthetic evaluations were recorded. Feasibility and safety were assessed. Among 891 BLSG patients, 89 (9.9%) underwent BLHHR. The mean distances between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, symphysis pubis, and anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) were 28.8 ± 2.2, 33.9 ± 3.1, and 31.2 ± 1.8 cm, respectively. Optimal visualization and accessibility of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) were achieved without compromising HHR repair or sleeve gastrectomy. The mean operative time was 76.5 ± 11 min, longer than the 58 ± 10 min required for BLSG alone. Patient scar satisfaction ranged from 87.5 to 97.9%, and the mean pain score was 2.9 ± 0.8. No major complications were reported. At 6 months, %EWL (percentage of excess weight loss) was 53.3 ± 13.7%, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) remission was achieved in 62.8% of patients and comorbidities were improved. BLHHR was potentially feasible and safe. Outcomes related to patient scar satisfaction, weight loss, improvement of associated comorbidities, and GERD symptoms were not compromised. The aesthetic benefits achieved by BLSG were maintained.",

Outcomes regarding patient scar satisfaction, weight loss, improvement of associated comorbidities, and GERD symptoms, were not compromised. The aesthetic gain achieved by BLSG was maintained. It could potentially be offered to a selected group of patients who are conscious about their scar appearance. However, this was a preliminary study conducted on a relatively small number of HH patients over a short period. To assess the widespread applicability and safety of BLHHR, long-term prospective controlled studies involving a larger number of patients are needed.",

Patients who underwent real-time MRI and pH-metry between 2015-2018 were included in this retrospective study. Real-time MRI at 3 T was achieved by undersampled radial FLASH acquisitions with iterative image reconstruction by NLINV. Real-time MRI visualized transit of pineapple juice through the gastroesophageal junction and during Valsalva maneuver. MRI results were compared to 24 h pH-metry to assess acidic reflux (following Lyon Consensus guidelines) and to impedance to assess non-acidic reflux. A standard 2 × 2 table was chosen to calculate diagnostic performance. 91/93 eligible patients fulfilled inclusion criteria (male n = 49; female n = 42; median age 55 y). All MRI studies were successfully completed without adverse events at a mean examination time of 15 min. On real-time MRI, reflux was evident in 60 patients (66 %). pH-metry revealed reflux in 41 patients (45 %), and impedance in 54 patients (59 %). Compared to pH-metry and impedance, real-time MRI sensitivity was 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.87), specificity 0.67 (95 % CI: 0.45-0.84) and PPV 0.87 (95 % CI: 0.75-0.94). Real-time MRI is an imaging method for assessment of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with GERD-like symptoms. Considering its high positive predictive value, real-time MRI can accurately identify patients in which further invasive testing with pH-metry and impedance might be considered.",

      "results": "In the first phase of the stability test, the pH electrode showed a fast response (rated as “excellent”) when in contact with each SBS. No signal drift occurred, and excellent accuracy was achieved (Figure 4A). In the second stage of the human gastric juice interference experiment, the electrode still had excellent responsiveness and accuracy in the pH 1.68 SBS, and no signal drift was observed (Figure 4B). In contrast, in the SBS measurement at pH 9.18, the pH electrode was evaluated as having a “good” responsiveness and accuracy grade after being disturbed by gastric juice, with no significant data drift (Figure 4C). Collectively, although the interference effect caused by human gastric juice in SBS at pH 9.18 was slightly larger than that in SBS at pH 1.68, the performance of the pH electrode was still within the acceptable operating range for practical applications.\n\nResults of pH electrode performance test. (A) Stability of pH electrode. (B and C) Anti-interference ability of pH electrode.\n\nThe reflux visualization and pH data recorded by the EndoMonitor System are shown in Supplementary Video 1 and Figure 5, respectively. The EndoMonitor System achieved 100% detection rates for horizontal acid reflux and distal acid and mixed reflux episodes, significantly outperforming the pH-impedance catheter (49.1%, 18.6%, and 32.7%, respectively, all P< 0.001; Table 1). Superior proximal reflux detection was also observed (acid reflux: 100% vs 90.9%, mixed reflux: 100% vs 88.1%, both P< 0.05).

Postoperative observation of the animals revealed that activity was normal, no signs of infection were observed in the surgical wound, and no adverse events were reported. The EndoMonitor System documented gastroesophageal junction laxity and patchy mucosal erythema in the distal esophagus (Figure 6A). Histopathologic change showed mild inflammation characterized by scattered inflammatory cell infiltration within the superficial lamina propria and intraepithelial regions as well as focal epithelial denudation (Figure 6B).\n\nEvaluation of gastroesophageal reflux animal modeling effect.

In contrast, the MII-pH catheter exhibited variable detection rates in these groups (Table 2). Statistically significant differences (P< 0.05) were observed in reflux episode detection rates between the EndoMonitor System and MII-pH catheter across four of six comparative groups. However, the overall reflux episode detection rate showed a statistically significant advantage for the EndoMonitor System (100% vs 82.0%; P< 0.001).

We sought to determine predictors of ARP failure in complex EA patients. Single-institution retrospective review of complex EA patients (e.g. long-gap EA, esophageal strictures, hiatal hernia, and reoperative ARP) who underwent an ARP from 2002 to 2019. ARP failure was defined as hiatal hernia recurrence, wrap migration/loosening, or need for reoperation. Predictors of failure were evaluated using univariate and multivariable time-to-event analysis. 121 patients underwent 140 ARP at a median age of 13.5 months (IQR 7, 26.5). Nissen fundoplication (89%) was the most common ARP. Mesh (bovine pericardium) reinforcement was used in 41% of the patients.

Two EA patients (5%) were prematurely born (<34 weeks).\n\nTwenty-four (62%) patients without EA had a diagnosis of GERD, considered severe enough to perform a fundoplication, without comorbidities, whereas 15 (38%) suffered from GERD in combination with the following comorbidities: failure to thrive (n = 10, 26%), prematurely born (n = 6, 15%), anemia (n = 4, 10%), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 1, 3%) or para-esophageal hernia (n = 1, 3%).\n\nMedian follow-up was 8.0 (0.5–12.0) years versus 7.5 (0.6–12.0) years for patients with- and without EA, respectively.\n\nEA patients were significantly more often on tube feeds at time of fundoplication (56% vs. 0%; P < 0.001, Table 1). Preoperative dysphagia (46% vs. 0%; P < 0.001) and feeding difficulties (28% vs. 0%; P < 0.001) were reported significantly more often in EA patients compared with non-EA patients (Table 2).\n\nPre and postoperative symptoms in EA patients versus controls\n\nEA, esophageal atresia; PPI, proton pump inhibitor; GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease\n\nThirty-two EA patients (82%) and 24 (62%) non-EA patients had more than one indication for fundoplication. Respiratory symptoms that were believed to be a consequence of GERD and recurrent BRUEs were the reason for fundoplication in a similar number of EA versus non-EA patients (51% vs. 59% and 23% vs. 18%, respectively; Table 1). Recurrent strictures as an indication for fundoplication were only reported in EA patients (79% vs. 0%; P < 0.001). Typical GERD symptoms/complications were less frequently reported in EA patients compared with non-EA patients (82% vs. 100%; P = 0.006). One EA patient (6 year old, EA subtype A) had intestinal metaplasia in the distal esophagus at time of fundoplication.\n\nIn EA patients, investigations performed before fundoplication included EGD in 33 (85%), contrast esophagogram in 33 (85%) and pH (+/−MII) measurement in 9 (23%). Six EA patients (15%) underwent all three tests (Fig. 1).\n\nDiagnostic tests performed in EA patients before fundoplication EGD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; CE, contrast esophagogram; pH+/−MII = pH +/−Multichannel intraluminal impedance measurement.\n\nIn EA patients, preoperative EGD (n = 33) revealed abnormalities in 12/33 (36%) children, including esophageal strictures in 6 (18%), EoE in 4 (12%, >15 eosinophils/HPF and macroscopic furrowing and exudate), hiatal hernia in 2 (6%), intestinal metaplasia in 1 (3%) and reflux esophagitis in 1 (3%). Patients with EoE showed decrease in eosinophils (<5/HPF) on budesonide slurry; however, therapy refractory GERD with persistent symptoms, abnormal pH-MII, erosive esophagitis and intestinal metaplasia (n = 1) was still present which led to the decision to proceed with fundoplication. Contrast esophagograms (n = 34) showed strictures in 6 (18%), hiatal hernia in 2 (6%) and esophageal diverticulum in 1 (3%). Although 31 (79%) EA patients suffered from recurrent strictures (Table 1), not all of these patients had a stricture at time of preoperative screening as a result of recent dilation.\n\nOf 9 pH-MII studies performed, 7/9 (78%) were abnormal (n = 5 positive symptom association; n = 2 positive symptom association and increased number of retrograde bolus movements; none showed elevated acid exposure times).\n\nTwenty-six EA patients did not have any abnormality reported on any of the abovementioned preoperative tests. Despite this, the decision to proceed to fundoplication was made on clinical grounds. Of these patients, 16 underwent EGD and contrast esophagogram, 5 underwent contrast esophagogram only, 4 EGD only and 1 patient underwent pH-impedance and contrast esophagogram.\n\nIn patients without EA, 38/39 (97%) underwent preoperative testing: 38/39 underwent EGD, which revealed reflux esophagitis in 4/38 (11%) cases. Contrast esophagograms were performed in 36/39 (92%) non-EA patients, all showed normal results. None of them underwent pH-MII testing.\n\nThere was no significant difference in surgical techniques between both groups (Table 1). All EA patients who underwent a partial fundoplication (n = 7) had preoperative dysphagia and three of them also had EoE. EA patients who underwent a complete fundoplication suffered significantly more often from regurgitation preoperatively (P = 0.03).\n\nIn one EA patient who underwent an open partial fundoplication, a gastric perforation and pleural effusion were detected 3 days post-fundoplication on CT scan. Patient underwent a relaparotomy for closure of the perforation and insertion of a chest drain. Postoperatively, he received intravenous antibiotics.\n\nEA patients had significantly worse fundoplication outcomes (Table 3). None of them achieved complete therapeutic success without development of symptoms/complications versus 17 (44%) non-EA patients (P < 0.001). In addition, 28% of EA patients had no therapeutic success at all versus 8% in patients without EA (P = 0.036).\n\nFundoplication outcome in EA patients\n\nTherapeutic success = improvement of symptoms/diseases that were the reason to perform a fundoplication.\n\nχ2 test for trend: EA patients have significantly different treatment outcomes compared with controls, P = <0.001. *Post hoc testing with χ2 test.\n\nRegurgitation, respiratory symptoms and strictures reduced postoperatively in a significant number of EA patients (P < 0.001, P = 0.002 and P = 0.022 respectively, Table 4). In non-EA patients, typical GERD symptoms/complications and respiratory symptoms also significantly decreased (P < 0.001, Table 4).\n\nPre versus postoperative symptoms in EA patients and controls\n\nEA, esophageal atresia; GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease; PPI, proton pump inhibitor.\n\nSymptom recurrence occurred in significantly more EA patients (36/39 [92%]) compared with non-EA patients (11/39 [28%], P < 0.001; Table 2) after a median time of 60 (1–360) days (n = 2 missing data regarding time of symptom recurrence).\n\nSignificantly more EA patients suffered from newly developed sustained dysphagia (41% vs. 13%; P = 0.039) and bloating (40% vs. 18%; P = 0.022) compared with patients without EA (Table 2). No differences in post-fundoplication outcomes were found between EA patients who underwent a partial versus a complete fundoplication (see Supplementary File 1).\n\nThirty-four (87%) EA patients were back on acid suppressive therapy after a median of 60 (12–360) days versus 11 (28%) patients without EA (P = 0.05, Table 2). Of the EA patients, 4/39 (10%) underwent a redo-fundoplication within the first 3 months post-fundoplication versus 3/40 (8%) patients without EA. Esophageal replacement surgery was performed in 4/39 (10%) EA patients who suffered from recalcitrant strictures despite fundoplication (Table 2).",

Twenty-five questions dedicated to definition, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of LPRD were developed from the Dubai definition and management of LPRD consensus and recent reviews. Questions about the four aforementioned categories were entered into ChatGPT-4. Four board-certified laryngologists evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 with a 5-point Likert scale. Interrater reliability was evaluated. The mean scores (SD) of ChatGPT-4 answers for definition, clinical presentation, additional examination, and treatments were 4.13 (0.52), 4.50 (0.72), 3.75 (0.61), and 4.18 (0.47), respectively. Experts reported high interrater reliability for sub-scores (ICC = 0.973). The lowest performances of ChatGPT-4 were on answers about the most prevalent LPR signs, the most reliable objective tool for the diagnosis (hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (HEMII-pH)), and the criteria for the diagnosis of LPR using HEMII-pH. ChatGPT-4 may provide adequate information on the definition of LPR, differences compared to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), and clinical presentation.

      "abstract": "Increased esophagogastric junction distensibility has been implicated in the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Previous authors have demonstrated a reduction in distensibility following anti-reflux surgery, but the changes during the operation are not clear. Our study aimed to ascertain the feasibility of measuring intraoperative distensibility changes and to assess if this would have potential to modify the operation. Seventeen patients with GERD were managed in a standardized manner consisting of preoperative assessment with symptom scoring, endoscopy, 24 hours pH studies, and manometry. Patients then underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with intraoperative distensibility measurement using an EndoFLIP EF-325 functional luminal imaging probe (Crospon Ltd, Galway, Ireland). This device utilizes impedance planimetry technology to measure cross-sectional area and distensibility within a balloon-tipped catheter. This is inflated at the esophagogastric junction to fixed distension volumes. Thirty-second median cross-sectional area and intraballoon pressure measurements were recorded at 30 and 40 mL balloon distensions. Measurement time points were initially after induction of anesthesia, after pneumoperitoneum, after hiatal mobilization, after hiatal repair, after fundoplication, and finally pre-extubation. Postoperatively, patients continued on protocol and were discharged after a two-night stay tolerating a sloppy diet. Patients with a hiatus hernia on high-resolution manometry had a significantly higher initial esophagogastric junction distensibility index (DI) than those without. Hiatus repair and fundoplication resulted in a significant overall reduction in the median DI from the initial to final recordings (30 mL balloon distension reduction of 3.26 mm(2) /mmHg (P = 0.0087), 40 mL balloon distension reduction of 2.39 mm(2) /mmHg [P = 0.0039]). There was also a significant reduction in the DI after pneumoperitoneum, hiatus repair, and fundoplication at 40 mL balloon distension. Two individual cases in the series highlight the utility of the system in potentially changing the operation. After fundoplication, patient 7 recorded a DI of 0.47 mm(2) /mmHg, the lowest in our series, and subsequently required reoperation because of significant symptoms of dysphagia. Patient 12 had a fundoplication that appeared visually too tight and was converted intraoperatively to a Lind 270° wrap resulting in a change in the DI from 0.65 to 0.89 mm(2) /mmHg. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication results in a significant reduction in the distensibility of the esophagogastric junction. The EndoFLIP system is able to demonstrate significant changes during the operation and may help guide intraoperative modification. Larger multicenter studies with long-term follow up would be beneficial to develop a target range of distensibility associated with good outcome.",

      "conclusion": "The field of neurogastroenterology and motility has developed into an area of significant scientific and clinic interest. However, it is important to note that despite the recent advances in technological innovations and better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying GI motility disorders, not all breakthroughs have translated into routine clinical practice. In the real-world setting, the choice of investigative technique is often dependent on local expertise, resource availability, and the ability of the investigative tool to translate into clinically meaningful actionable information. The inherent worth of upper GI motility testing lies in its ability to provide physiological explanation to the symptoms, provide reassurance to the patient that there is no structural pathology and provide a platform for personalised symptom-based management. This remains the most important clinical impact of functional GI evaluation. Figures 1 to 3 illustrate how the commonly available upper GI investigations fit into routine clinical practice. Figure 1 summarises the approach to the evaluation of patients presenting with nonacute oesophageal dysphagia, while Figures 2 and 3 summarise the approach to the evaluation of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal reflux.\n\nChart shows the approach to the evaluation of adult patients with nonacute oesophageal dysphagia for solids and liquids. aSome patients with inconclusive manometric findings may evolve to a well-defined diagnosis over time.

Reduction in the amount of saliva produced results in an increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be objectively measured by the DeMeester score. The impact of increased chewing strokes on the DeMeester score remains largely unknown, thus this study aimed to find out their impact on the value of the DeMeester score and its individual components.The effect of increased chewing strokes on the DeMeester score was investigated in 12 subjects (5 male and 7 female) who were diagnosed with GERD. All subjects underwent a 48-hour pH monitoring using the Bravo® pH capsule. All the patients chewed their food 20 times more on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. The data were analyzed for change in the DeMeester score and its individual components in 2 days.In patients with GERD (DeMeester score > 14.72 on Day 1), the number of long refluxes (>5 minutes) on Day 2 (mean = 3.2, SD = 2.3) was significantly lower than on Day 1 (mean = 6.4, SD = 2.7); Z = -2.032, p = 0.04. Though, the DeMeester score and its other individual parameters decreased on Day 2, they were not statistically significant.In patients with GERD, increased chewing strokes lead to a decrease in the number of long reflux episodes.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the use of dexlansoprazole, presence of dyslipidemia, and typical GERD symptoms (acid reflux and heartburn) were predictors for symptom response for cough; the use of dexlansoprazole and presence of erosive esophagitis were predictors for symptom response for globus (P all < 0.05). No predictor for therapy response to hoarseness was noted.

      "conclusion": "In conclusion, dementia stands as an urgent global health concern, affecting millions globally and imposing significant economic and caregiving burdens, particularly on women and in countries with low or middle incomes. This review highlights the emerging association between prolonged PPI usage and dementia, drawing attention to the potential link between cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions. Conflicting findings across different studies demonstrate the complex nature of this association. Long-term PPI use may be unsafe for our brains in various ways, such as changing the pH of brain cells as changing brain cells and causing Aβ peptides to build up. The treatment of elderly patients with PPI therapy should be personalized and cautious, involving alternative medications and gradual dosage reduction. Regular follow-up and comprehensive medication reviews are crucial for patient safety and holistic health, especially in the vulnerable geriatric population. Healthcare providers, particularly when caring for older adults, need to carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of PPI therapy, taking into account alternative treatments when appropriate.",
      "results": "A study involving 36,360 patients prescribed PPI medication between 2002 and 2015 found a modest increase in dementia risk but not a higher incidence of AD compared to 99,362 non-exposed participants. The study was based on CatSalut Database Data [123]. A retrospective cohort study found no significant difference in sequence ratio between dementia and PPIs (7342 pairings, sequence ratio 1.21), suggesting an overestimation of PPIs' link to dementia [124]. A study in Taiwan found that patients without a dementia history who started taking PPI (n = 6584) for about five years without a prescription were more likely to have dementia. The findings, based on insurance claims data from Taiwan, support the negative effects of PPIs on dementia risk, highlighting the need for better healthcare policies and interventions [125]. According to one more study that analyzed 23,656 veterans' records, including 11,828 PPI and non-PPI veterans. Dementia affected 9.5% of PPI veterans, while 6.3% of the control group experienced it. A significant correlation was found between PPI usage and dementia, with a 51.4% increase in the relative risk of dementia. PPI users had a 1.55% odds ratio for dementia risk compared to nonusers. Dementia rates varied among PPI users, with rabeprazole users having the highest rate at 12.8%, 10.9% for lansoprazole, 9.7% for omeprazole, 7.7% for esomeprazole, and 7.0% for pantoprazole [126].\n\nA 5-year study found a correlation between PPI use and dementia in a retrospective cohort of 10,533 older people. The study observed three PPI use trajectories: short-term, intermittent, and long-term. Long-term and intermittent PPI users did not appear to have a higher risk of dementia compared to short-term users. Over a 4-year mean follow-up period, PPIs did not substantially increase the risk of dementia, regardless of the use pattern [127]. A study involving subjects with persistent cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease found that using pantoprazole (40 mg daily, n = 8791) for three years did not cause any side effects, including cognitive impairment, in a placebo-controlled trial. The only possible side effect was an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections. Researchers conducted the study in a 3 × 2 partial factorial double-blind experiment [128].\n\nA total of 7878 twins (n = 4314 for MADT and n = 3615 for LSADT) and 4821 participants had baseline data available for cross-sectional analysis and follow-up studies, respectively. When analyzing data from two large population-based studies, researchers could not find any correlation between PPI use and cognitive impairment [129]. A longitudinal clinical study found no link between PPI use and increased dementia or AD risk. The study relied on self-reported PPI use and a lack of dispensing data. In this study, a cohort of 50 volunteers was investigated, revealing that 884 individuals were regular consumers of PPI, 1,925 reported occasional PPI usage, and 7,677 participants had never taken PPI. At the initiation of the study, all subjects exhibited either normal cognitive function or mild cognitive impairment [130]. Among the 642,949 participants in the meta-analysis of 11 observational studies, women comprised 64%. The majority of the research only lasted between five and ten years. In all, 483,995 people did not utilize PPI, whereas 158,954 people did. The investigation did not support the suggested connection between PPI use and an elevated risk of dementia (Table 1) [131].",

      "conclusion": "The ability to characterize spatiotemporal abnormalities in pediatric functional nausea could help clarify clinical phenotypes. Our results indicate that HR-EGG shows sufficient sensitivity and may present an effective, low-cost, and portable tool for the noninvasive clinical detection of key pathological signatures of pediatric functional nausea. While we are using a commercial amplifier to record gastric signals, the Alimetry ambulatory system offers a commercial, wearable reader attached to an 8 × 8 electrode recording array for similar body surface gastric slow wave mapping. Standard analysis from both systems include time–frequency analyses of the gastric slow wave. The Alimetry system presumably would require modification for combined using with other slow wave recording methods, like the SQUID biomagnetometer we have used previously.9,10,13\n\nLimitations of the study include lack of blinding to analysis and age disparity between healthy controls (14.3 ± 1.8) and inactive nausea patients (16.1 ± 1.1, P = .01). Our study did not use single or double blinding since our aim was to characterize the quantitative differences between subject populations. The possibility of identification of pediatric nausea using HR-EGG with double-blinded study designs should be the subject of future work. Control and patient populations included a minor gender difference and a statistically insignificant age difference [or minor gender and age differences], but we do not expect these differences to substantially influence the results of the study. Clinical limitations of HR-EGG are morbid obesity and the necessity of the child to remain silent and still for the entirety of the study. However, the HR-EGG can characterize gastric slow waves by 1) frequency and corresponding distribution of spectral power and 2) spatiotemporal slow wave propagation maps, direction, and speed. This noninvasive quantifiable metric may lead to individualized diagnosis and treatment options.",

There was significantly higher bradygastria, between 1.2 and 2 cpm, in patients compared to normal controls (control 20.0 ± 10.6; patient 28.1 ± 9.5; P < .01). Borderline differences were seen in the tachygastric range (control 21.0% ± 8.5%; patient 25.3% ± 6.8%; P = .06).\n\nReconstruction of HR-EGG SOBI sources onto the sensor array allows us to visualize the propagation of gastric slow wave activity via animated spatiotemporal heat maps that portray the highest area of electrical potential in dark red (Figure 4A). Dark red areas moving across the screen provide a visual representation of electrical activity moving across the stomach surface as it pertains to the subject’s abdomen. The calibration of these heat maps is designed so that the initial frame exhibits the highest intensity in the upper right corner, aligning with the presumed location of the stomach’s pacemaker region.Figure 4(A) Representative depiction of HR-EGG propagation map during the preprandial period in a healthy pediatric subject showing normal anterograde electrical activity moving from right to left and top to bottom (subject’s left to right) across the 25-channel cutaneous electrode array positioned on the skin surface.

In control subjects, the mean propagation speed in the preprandial period was 13.0 ± 3.4 mm/s with a median value of 12.7 mm/s. Patients had a lower mean propagation speed in the preprandial period of 9.8 ± 3.5 mm/s (P < .001) with a median value of 9.5 mm/s.\n\nMathematically, we validated the visualization of propagation direction dynamics by creating polar histograms, which describe the mean distribution of slow wave direction, thus quantifying our qualitative measurements (Figure 4C–D).\n\nIn control subjects, we observed dominant normal anterograde SOBI HR-EGG propagation patterns. This anterograde activity is typical for healthy subjects since peristalsis should move from the corpus toward the pylorus. The propagation direction of the gastric slow wave was calculated using the reconstructed SOBI HR-EGG data. The polar histograms (Figure 4C–D) show fasting HR-EGG mean slow wave propagation direction was significantly different in controls (228° ± 49°) as compared to the disrupted slow wave propagation seen in functional nausea patients (20° ± 79°; P ˂ .05). As we have previously reported for actively symptomatic pediatric functional nausea patients (BARF 2–8) can present with multiple types of propagation patterns including retrograde, anterograde, anterograde/retrograde reversal, and disrupted movements, with the most common activity being retrograde or disrupted.9 The non–actively symptomatic functional nausea patients in this study had disrupted propagation and frequency dynamics similar to the pediatric patients that were moderately to severely nauseated at the time of the study.",

It causes one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting about half of the world's population. However, it should be noted that the prevalence of H. pylori, particularly in the Western world, has significantly decreased coinciding with an increase of some autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as asthma. Various epidemiological studies have also documented a negative association between H. pylori colonization and the presence of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and risk of esophageal cancer. Additionally, an upward trend of obesity recently observed in inhabitants of developed countries raised a question about the relationship between H. pylori infection and the human body mass index. The first part of this review describes common, recommended anti-H. pylori treatments. The second part, presents the results of recent experiments aimed at evaluating the association between H. pylori infections and gastro-esophageal diseases, the level of stomach hormones, the human body mass index and allergic diseases. Although some studies suggest an inverse association of H. pylori infection with some health problems of the modern world such as asthma, obesity or GERD, H. pylori should be considered as a harmful human pathogen responsible for serious and sometimes lethal diseases. Thus, many scientists advocate the eradication of H. pylori.",

      "conclusion": "When considering the formulation design for antibacterial therapy, it is important to develop the carriers that can stabilize the active ingredients and improve delivery into the infection sites. Increasing attention has been paid to nanomedicine as an approach for applying bacterial targeting or delivery. The use of antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles is considered a valid strategy for bacteria targeting because of its numerous advantages over conventional formulations, including improved stability, controlled antibiotic release, targeted capability, and increased bioavailability. Some issues, such as solubility, drug resistance, and epithelium permeation, can also be resolved by nanocarriers' targeting pathogens. Though many nanocarriers have been developed for testing in cell-based and animal studies, clinical trials for bacteria-delivery application are still limited. This may be due to the high cost of clinical trials and the unknown side effects that should be first identified and explored. Nanosystems are thought to cause more serious adverse effects on organisms compared to the bulk materials, as their very small size causes a correspondingly higher surface area. The researchers should pay attention only not to nanoparticles' therapeutic benefits but also to their toxic responses on human health. Caution should be used in optimizing the feasible conditions of nanomedicine for balancing the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy and tissue damage. For use in future human applications, the materials utilized for preparing antibacterial nanoparticles should be non-toxic, biodegradable and biocompatible. The materials approved by the FDA may be the first choices for the development of these nanocarriers. There are already some experiences of antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles approved by FDA for clinical application. It is expected that more antibacterial nanoparticles will be released for clinical use. Because of the improvement of industrial preparation and scale-up in the recent years, the visibility of commercially antibacterial nanoparticles can be raised in the near future. The introduction and description of the nanocarriers for bacterial and infection site targeting outlined in this review may provide relevant information to investigators involved in designing feasible and efficient delivery systems for the treatment of bacteria and its related diseases. It is preferable if some suggestions can be made for selecting the nanoparticles with best antibacterial efficiency. However, this intention is difficult to achieve since different investigations involved in the development of antibacterial nanoparticles employ different evaluation platforms. Although the MIC is the assay most-frequently used, the protocols of MIC determination are always different among different studies. Thus it should be cautious to compare the antimicrobial activity of the various types of nanosystem. Nevertheless, the comparison of antibacterial effect of the nanoparticles with a positive control antibiotic approved for clinical application is suggested.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a classic example of inflammation-associated cancer, which develops through GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)-Barrett's esophagus (BE)-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence. The incidence of EAC has been rising rapidly in the USA and Western countries during the last few decades. The functions of glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7), an antioxidant enzyme frequently silenced during Barrett's tumorigenesis, remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we investigated the potential role of GPX7 in regulating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity in esophageal cells. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and luciferase reporter assay data indicated that reconstitution of GPX7 expression in CP-A (non-dysplastic BE cells) and FLO-1 (EAC cells) abrogated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity (P < 0.01) and nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 (P = 0.01). In addition, we detected a marked reduction in phosphorylation levels of components of NF-κB signaling pathway, p-p65 (S536), p-IκB-α (S32) and p-IKKα/β (S176/180), as well as significant suppression in induction of NF-κB target genes [TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2] following treatment with TNF-α in GPX7-expressing FLO-1 cells as compared with control cells. We validated these effects by knockdown of GPX7 expression in HET1A (normal esophageal squamous cells). We found that GPX7-mediated suppression of NF-κB is independent of reactive oxygen species level and GPX7 antioxidant function. Further mechanistic investigations demonstrated that GPX7 promotes protein degradation of TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), suggesting that GPX7 modulates critical upstream regulators of NF-κB. We concluded that the loss of GPX7 expression is a critical step in promoting the TNF-α-induced activation of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling, a major player in GERD-associated Barrett's carcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "To evaluate the role of smoking in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and erosive esophagitis (E) compared to endoscopic controls with no BE or E. Smoking is considered a cause of both BE and E, but results on this topic are quite controversial. Patients with BE (339), E (462) and controls (619: 280 with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)-negative and 339 with GERD-positive anamnesis) were recruited in 12 Italian endoscopy units. Data were obtained from structured questionnaires. Among former smokers, a remarkable upward linear trend was found in BE for all smoking-related predictors. In particular, having smoked for more than 32 years increased the risk more than two times (OR 2.44, 95 % CL 1.33-4.45). When the analysis was performed in the subgroup of subjects with GERD-negative anamnesis, the risk of late quitters (<9 years) passed from OR 2.11 (95 % CL 1.19-3.72) to OR 4.42 (95 % CL 1.52-12.8). A noticeably positive dose-response relationship with duration was seen also among current smokers. As regards E, no straightforward evidence of association was detected, but for an increased risk of late quitters (OR 1.84, 95 % CL 1.14-2.98) in former smokers and for early age at starting (OR 3.63, 95 % CL 1.19-11.1) in GERD-negative current smokers. Smoking seems to be an independent determinant of BE and, to a lesser degree, of E. The elevation in risk is independent from GERD and is already present in light cigarette smokers. Smoking cessation may reduce, but not remove this risk.",

      "conclusion": "The implications of these findings are significant from both a public health and clinical perspective. Efforts to reduce exposure to environmental pollutants, such as PM, could potentially mitigate the burden of upper gastrointestinal diseases in affected populations. Similarly, targeted interventions aimed at reducing smoking behavior and promoting smoking cessation may help reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal disease and malignancy. Furthermore, continued research into the potential health effects of emerging trends, such as vaping and marijuana use, is crucial for informing preventive strategies and improving patient outcomes.\n\nThis review provides support for the connection between environmental exposures and digestive health, which is especially important considering that those who have been exposed to environmental/occupational inhalants are generally not screened for gastrointestinal disease as part of their exposure. We hope that this review will promote further recognition of the treatment of digestive disease with inhalational exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, this systematic review contributes to our understanding of the interplay between exposure to inhalational exposures and diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. By analyzing existing evidence and identifying knowledge gaps, this study highlights the need for approaches to address environmental risk factors and promote gastrointestinal health.",

Studies that focused on any other outcomes did not meet exclusion/inclusion criteria. The investigated exposures were smoking, waterpipe smoking, and PM2.5/PM10 exposure. While there were no studies that focused on marijuana smoking or vaping/e-cigarettes that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria we know from the literature that the use of cannabinoids and vaping are linked to the development of gastrointestinal disorders149. One study investigated the role of exposure to second-hand smoke, in addition to direct cigarette smoke exposure70. Most studies produced an odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), correlation coefficient (CC), or hazard ratio (HR) to measure each of the risks associated with their respective exposures for a particular outcome, which are summarized in Fig. 2 (see raw data in Supplemental Table 8 A–E). Among those studies, some reported using adjusted models in their analyses. Additionally, other studies focused on the percent presentation of risk factors;40,53 risk by measuring the increase in incidence of the respective disease;73,92–94 the differences in mortality with respect to magnitude of exposure95and utilized a novel predictive model to identify risk factors, Table 198.\n\nCurrent tobacco use was identified as a significant risk factor for reflux esophagitis (RE)41,44,58,65,115,122,134. Some studies focused on specific groups of patients and found that smoking was associated with RE among COPD patients124 and liver cirrhosis patients130. When studying gender-specific differences between smoking and risk of RE, Kim et al. found that smoking led to greater risks of RE among women compared to men51, whereas Wang et al. found that smoking led to greater risks of RE among men141. Lee et al. identified smoking as a significant risk factor for asymptomatic erosive esophagitis (EE)54. Associations between smoking and eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE) were also investigated. One study found that those with EOE were significantly less likely to have ever smoked cigarettes compared to non-EOE controls, but smoking was not significantly associated with an increased risk of EOE53.\n\nOur meta-analysis of 8 studies41,53,54,65,115,124,130,141 revealed that inhalational exposures were significantly associated with an increased risk of esophagitis with a pooled estimate of 1.32 (95% CI 1.06–1.65; I2 = 86%), Fig. 3A. In our sensitivity analysis, we excluded one study53 that had high heterogeneity; however, the analysis results revealed no significant differences with a pooled estimate of 1.43 (95% CI 1.15–1.78; I2 = 86%), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 (1.3A vs 1.3A’).\n\nFig. 2Overview of data synthesis: (A) Summary of odds ratios for esophageal diseases (esophagitis, BE, ECa), (B) Summary of odds ratios for gastric diseases (GERD, PUD, GCa), (C) Summary of risk ratios, (D) Summary of correlation coefficients, (E) Summary of hazard ratios.\n\nOverview of data synthesis: (A) Summary of odds ratios for esophageal diseases (esophagitis, BE, ECa), (B) Summary of odds ratios for gastric diseases (GERD, PUD, GCa), (C) Summary of risk ratios, (D) Summary of correlation coefficients, (E) Summary of hazard ratios.\n\nFig. 3Meta-analysis of the association between inhalational exposures and upper gastrointestinal diseases: (A) esophagitis, (B) GERD, (C) BE, (D) PUD, (E) ECa, (F) GCa.\n\nMeta-analysis of the association between inhalational exposures and upper gastrointestinal diseases: (A) esophagitis, (B) GERD, (C) BE, (D) PUD, (E) ECa, (F) GCa.\n\nMultiple studies identified smoking as a risk factor for GERD43,45,57,59,72,102,105. Kim et al. interestingly found that former smoking was significantly associated with risk of GERD, while current smoking was not significantly associated50. When investigating gender-specific differences in the effects of smoking on the risk of GERD, Kim et al. found that smoking increased risks in both men and women51. One study investigated the effects of waterpipe smoking in addition to traditional cigarette smoking on the risk of GERD. Etemadi et al. found that waterpipe smoking was most strongly associated with “severe and frequent” reflux, and the prevalence of the disease was associated with waterpipe use and duration. In addition, they found that cigarette smoking was a significant risk factor for any form of reflux among men87. Additionally, Wang et al. identified smoking and male gender as significant risk factors for reflux esophagitis, a subtype of GERD141. Similarly, a significant association between smoking and increased risk of RE has been reported in multiple studies122,124,130,134While other researches has found no significant association between GERD and smoking103. Almadi et al. observed a higher prevalence of GERD among smokers than non-smokers, but found no significant difference38. Wang et al. also did not find any association between cigarette smoking and risk of GERD79. Seo et al. developed a prediction model that was significantly able to predict GERD-related medical utilization in the South Korean population and identified PM2.5 as a risk factor for GERD98.\n\nOur meta-analysis of 7 studies43,45,72,102,133,138,140 revealed that inhalational exposures were significantly associated with increased risk of GERD with a pooled estimate of 1.71 (95% CI 1.14–2.55; I2 = 94%), Fig. 3B In our sensitivity analysis, we excluded one study102 that had high heterogeneity; the analysis results revealed a reduction of I2 after removing Ahmed 2020 showing differences with a pooled estimate of 1.34 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.68; I2 = 78%), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 (1.3B vs 1. 3B′).\n\nSmoking was identified as a risk factor for BE41,58,142. Schmidt et al. found that BE cases were significantly more likely to smoke73. Navab et al. found a positive correlation between current and prior tobacco use and BE63. Etemadi et al. found associations between smoking and BE that were independent of intensity, age at initiation, and GERD, but dependent on duration and years since cessation87. Other studies, however, produced conflicting results: some studies found that current and former smoking were not significantly associated with BE43,84. Additionally, Arroyo-Martínez et al. found that cigarette smoking showed no significant association with any form of the progression of BE106.\n\nOur meta-analysis of 4 studies revealed that inhalational exposures were not significantly associated with risk of BE with a pooled estimate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.65–1.34; I2 = 76%), Fig. 3C. Sensitivity analysis was not performed since study weight and effect size were not concerning.\n\nGhanadi et al. found that smoking history was significantly associated with PUD116. Similarly, Chuang et al. also identified current tobacco use as a significant risk factor for PUD and that higher cumulative amounts of tobacco use were at higher risk for PUD41. Further, Begovic et al. found that more than half of ulcer patients enrolled in their study were smokers, and this difference was significant when compared to those who were non-smokers40. Levenstein et al. observed that age-, gender-, and socioeconomic status-adjusted associations were significant for smoking55. Park et al. investigated the role of changes in smoking status in the risk of gastroduodenal ulcer68. They observed that changes in smoking status, particularly from never smoker or former smoker to current smoker, had relatively higher HRs than other groups. When comparing smoking amount levels, they found that smokers who smoked > 20 pack-years had a significantly higher risk of PUD.\n\nThe role of PM exposure as a risk of PUD has been studied. Tsai et al. found that increases in both PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with increased risk of PUD hospitalizations on warm days, but only PM10 was significantly associated with cold days99. Similarly, Wong et al. found that PUD hospitalization was associated with 10 ug/m3 increases in PM2.5. When investigating different types of ulcers, they found that associations with PM2.5 were significant for gastric ulcers, but not for duodenal ulcers91. Wu et al. observed that cumulative RRs for PM2.5 and PM10 showed nearly linear adverse effects100. When looking at gender-adjusted differences, significant associations for men and women were only observed for PM2.5. Quan et al. found that when air pollution exposures were assessed over 3-, 5-, and 7-day averages, pollutants were inversely associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)96. Yu et al. observed a potential dose-response relationship between quartile concentrations of PM2.5 one month before detection of PUD. Subjects in the highest quartile of PM2.5 exposure displayed significantly higher risk, and the detection of PUD was associated with a 10 ug/m3 in PM2.5101. Our meta-analysis of 5 studies41,96,99,101,116 revealed that inhalational exposures were significantly associated with increased risk of PUD with a pooled estimate of 1.21 (95% CI 1.03–1.43; I2 = 93%), Fig. 3D. Sensitivity analysis was not performed since the study with a different effect size had a low weight.\n\nSmoking as a risk factor for ECa was the focus of several studies62,74,86,104,107,108,120,123,126,127,131,132,136. Other studies focused on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and also identified smoking as a risk factor and this risk increased with tobacco intensity and smoking duration131but there was no significant difference with respect to macroscopic type of cancer, as smoking showed similarly increased risks for both ulcerative type and medullary type eosinophilic squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)48,52,61,75,81,82. Jayalekshmi et al. observed higher risks of ESCC for current bidi and cigarette smokers47. In gender association studies, Chen et al. found that there was a significant association between smoking and ECa in men, but not in women110. Etemadi A et al. studied how among tobacco users, metabolites of styrene and xylene were associated with ESCC, showing how specific components of tobacco smoke could contribute to disease112.\n\nConversely, some studies observed a non-significant relationship between inhalational exposures and ECa41,66,83,137. Arroyo-Martínez et al. found that cigarette smoking showed no significant association with any forms of progression of EAC, but in all forms of progression, smoking showed the highest association in the progression of BE without dysplasia to EAC106. Interestingly, Guo et al. found that current smoking was not significantly associated with any esophageal neoplasms while former smoking was106,118. However, Sheikh M et al. demonstrated that smoking cigarettes was not associated with the risk of ESCC139. Pournaghi et al. found a significant association between hookah smoking and an elevated risk of ESCC. Additionally, the same study identified that individuals who had quit smoking more than 10 times had a higher risk of ESCC137. Furthermore, a study on cumulative tar exposure revealed that individuals in the second tertile had an increased risk of ESCC, although this association became non-significant after adjusting for pack-years due to the high correlation between cumulative tar and pack-years132. Some studies looked at how smoking affected survival for those afflicted with ECa. Spreafico et al. found that smoking conferred worse overall survival in the combined Boston-Toronto Cohort for each 20 pack-year increase77. Others observed how current and former smoking contributed to decreased survival with respect to subtypes, specifically ESCC and EAC80,84. Dighe et al. found that current smoking was significantly associated with mortality of stage I-III ECa111. There were studies, however, that undermined this relationship121.\n\nOne study in particular, Rafiq R et al. evaluated both smoking and second-hand smoke as a risk factor for ECa, with increased risks associated with either exposure70. Pan et al. conducted two studies on the association between smoking and esophageal precancerous lesions (EPL), finding that smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day or having 40 or more pack-years of cumulative smoking was significantly associated with an elevated risk of EPL67,135. Cigarette smoking was also associated with the development of esophageal neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) and the risk increased to 4.7 times for all cases and to 4.0 for pure NEN cases143.\n\nThe relationship between PM2.5 exposure and ECa was also assessed. Li et al. observed a significantly positive association between PM2.5 and ECa incidence. When investigating the corresponding lag effects on ECa incidence, they found that a lag effect of 4 years showed the greatest risk for the overall population92. Li et al. examined the modifying effects of urbanization and socioeconomic factors and found a stronger association between PM2.5 and incidence for low urbanization groups, and this association was stronger for females than males93. Some studies identified long-term exposure to various components of PM2.5 such as black carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, sulfates, chlorides, and ammonium to be significantly associated with ECa94,148. Rao et al. found that although spatial distributions of the hospitalization rate of ECa in 2016 were not consistent with that of PM2.5 concentration in the same year, concentrations of PM2.5 in 2003 and 2004 had the strongest correlations with the hospitalization rate in 201697. Sun D et al. observed a linear concentration-response relationship between long-term PM2.5 and ECa90. Huang et al. found that PM10 and NO2 had significant linear correlations with ECa mortality rates147. Our meta-analysis of 20 studies41,61,66,67,70,75,81–83,86,107,108,118,123,126,131,132,135,136,143 revealed that inhalational exposures were significantly associated with increased risk of ECa; pooled estimate of 1.83(95% CI1.54–2.18; I2 = 73%), Fig. 3E.\n\nAs with the previous outcomes, most studies identified smoking as a risk factor for GCa113,117,119,125,127,144. Increased risk of GCa was associated with current cigarette smoking status, longer durations of smoking (at least 20 years) or later starting ages of smoking56. Current smoking was also found to have an increased risk of mortality from stomach cancer60. When assessing changes in smoking status, one study found that those who changed their current status to “smoking” showed an increased risk of GCa, and this risk was the highest in heavier smokers69. One study found that smoking was only significantly associated with single GCa and synchronous multiple gastric cancer in advanced gastric cancer patients76.\n\nCurrent smoking also showed increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma80. Additionally, another study highlighted that smoking history was significantly associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma125. Interestingly, Jayalekshmi et al. found that bidi smoking was significantly associated with GCa risk, but cigarette smoking was not. This risk increased with the number of bidis smoked daily and with the duration of bidi smoking46. Conversely, Chuang YS et al. found that tobacco use was a non-significant risk factor for GCa41. Other studies found that current smoking increased risks of intestinal metaplasia for both men and women. Further, this risk increased with increasing duration and total dose49,78. Chen et al. found that smoking significantly increased the risk of progression from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia109.\n\nIn gender association studies, Chen ZM et al. found that there was a significant association between smoking and esophageal cancer in men, but not in women110.\n\nSome studies investigated the role of waterpipe smoking in GCa risk. Several studies in Vietnam showed that waterpipe smoking was positively associated with GCa risk, but there was no significant interaction between the effects of water pipes and cigarette smoking on GCa risk64,88,89. Additionally, Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), commonly known as secondhand smoke, has also been identified as a potential risk factor for GCa, suggesting that passive exposure to tobacco smoke may contribute to increased risk128.\n\nStill, other studies found no such significant relationship between smoking and GCa114,129. Interestingly, Guo et al. found that current smoking was not significantly associated with any gastric neoplasms while former smoking was118.\n\nOther studies investigated the relationship between PM and GCa. Some studies identified long-term exposure to various components of PM2.5 such as black carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, sulfates, chlorides, and ammonium to be significantly associated with GCa94,148. Ethan et al. found that as a single pollutant and as a multipollutant in combination with NO2, PM2.5 was significantly associated with stomach cancer mortality145. Fan et al. found that each 1ug/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increase in the risk of GCa146. Our meta-analysis of 13 studies41,56,64,71,78,85,86,109,113,114,118,129,144 revealed that inhalational exposures were significantly associated with increased risk of GCa with a pooled estimate of 1.71 (95% CI 1.39–2.10; I2 = 94%), Fig. 3F. Sensitivity analysis was not performed for ECa and GCa there were a relatively large number of studies and therefore the their moderate heterogeneity was to be expected.",

      "abstract": "Development of these guidelines is mandated by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Recommendations are based on diligent review of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors. There are 9 broad clinical questions with 123 recommendation numbers that include 160 specific statements (85 [53.1%] strong [Grade A], 48 [30.0%] intermediate [Grade B], and 11 [6.9%] weak [Grade C], with 16 [10.0%] based on expert opinion [Grade D]) that build a comprehensive medical care plan for obesity. There were 133 (83.1%) statements based on strong (best evidence level [BEL] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or intermediate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) levels of scientific substantiation. There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based recommendation grades (Grades A-C = 144) that were adjusted based on subjective factors. Among the 1,788 reference citations used in this CPG, 524 (29.3%) were based on strong (evidence level [EL] 1), 605 (33.8%) were based on intermediate (EL 2), and 308 (17.2%) were based on weak (EL 3) scientific studies, with 351 (19.6%) based on reviews and opinions (EL 4). The final recommendations recognize that obesity is a complex, adiposity-based chronic disease, where management targets both weight-related complications and adiposity to improve overall health and quality of life. The detailed evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses real-world medical care of patients with obesity, including screening, diagnosis, evaluation, selection of therapy, treatment goals, and individualization of care. The goal is to facilitate high-quality care of patients with obesity and provide a rational, scientific approach to management that optimizes health outcomes and safety.

      "conclusion": "GLP-1 RAs, especially semaglutide and tirzepatide, are effective for weight management. Liraglutide may remain a viable, cost-effective alternative.",
      "results": "A total of 22 RCTs involving 41,757 participants were included. Among adults with T2DM, the greatest weight reductions were observed with tirzepatide 15 mg (−9.5 kg at 40 weeks; 72% lost ≥ 5% of baseline weight) and semaglutide 2.4 mg (−9.6% body weight at 68 weeks; 69% lost ≥ 5%). In participants without T2DM, semaglutide 2.4 mg (−14.9% body weight at 68 weeks) and tirzepatide 15 mg (−20.9% at 72 weeks) produced the most substantial effects, while semaglutide 50 mg was also effective in nondiabetic patients. Liraglutide 3 mg showed modest efficacy. Across trials, GLP-1 RAs were consistently associated with a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to placebo, including nausea (14%–28% vs. 5%–10%), vomiting (6%–12% vs. 2%–4%), and diarrhea (8%–20% vs. 4%–7%). The risk of pancreatitis and serious adverse events remained comparable to placebo.",
